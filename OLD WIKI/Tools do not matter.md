tagline: "I aspire, with great discomfort and effort, to adhere to tool agnosticism"
introduction: '[Dan Russell](https://sites.google.com/site/dmrussell/) told Lifehacker [late 2013](https://lifehacker.com/im-dan-russell-google-research-scientist-and-this-is-1450690468): "I could reboot my work environment in just an hour or so with a decent Internet connection, any laptop, and a stationary store." I have yet to convince myself this is a bad idea.'

In my journey as a human with a personal computer, and more specifically as somebody who performs [[Knowledge work]], I've come to prefer platform- and application-agnostic computing over anything else. When I consider using a particular app or platform, I pay close attention to how it will let me work with the things I create. This has helped me keep my writing organized since 2005.

Like everybody else I have tool preferences, and I get [[Tool vibes]] from time to time. I prefer Spark over other email apps, I enjoy Obsidian more than other note-taking apps, and I will choose Mac OS X over any other operating system. Still, central to my choices is that I don't want any long-term engagement with products that force me to limit my opportunities.

### Tools don't matter means:
- I focus my attention on an object, not on the tool I can use to manipulate it (example: I keep a large collection of plain text files in my [[Second brain]]. Over the years, I've used countless apps to manipulate these files.)
- With analog writing, rather than fixing myself to a particular method of archiving, or a set of writing tools (which is what a part of me desperately needs) I mix up where and how I write.
- I don't use desktop or smartphone apps that require me to export my data and back it up independently (example: Evernote, Moodnotes)
