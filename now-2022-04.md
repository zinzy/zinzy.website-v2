# Now: April 2022
It's odd to think about what life was like in the Spring of 2021, or even 2020. Sure, we were definitely working on our little street-side garden, hoping to bring some color to the neighborhood, but other than that, not much was the same at home. We had a living room office, each with our own command center. Now, things are slowly returning to normal. We've installed new kitchen counters, getting our couch reupholstered. It feels like the house is becoming a home again.

At Leeruniek, I'm focused on creating a user-centered mode of collaboration. It's great fun work with colleagues from outside the product team, and develop a shared understanding of what we and what we do mean to our customers. Part of this effort involves cultivating a culture of receiving and giving feedback, something I find very refreshing. We're also hiring in the product team and we've already found a new engineer and a new designer. I'm looking forward to exploring our new team setup.
