This website, which is a vastly personal project, contains many blog posts that I've written since 2009. Some of the things I like to share are less time-bound: they're lists, recommendations, knowledge I've acquired throughout the years. These things are stored in this area, my personal wiki.

[They're no longer my actual working notes](https://tech.lgbt/@zinzy/109762215863198767), but they do give you some more insight into what I love, how I do certain things, and what I'm learning while I read. There's no index of these notes, so instead I'm happy to provide you starting points for a scavenger hunt.
