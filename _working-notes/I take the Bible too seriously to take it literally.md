I don't consider the Jewish Tenach and Christian New Testament (or Christian Bible) to be the literal word of God. I believe it was written, edited, rewritten, summarized and edited again across a long period by a vast number of people.  I do not believe it is required for a Christian to believe in this divine authorship for them to be considered a proper Christian.
