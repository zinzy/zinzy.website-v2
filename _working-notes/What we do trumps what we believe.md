Within the context of religion and the relationship I may maintain with a higher power, I prefer to focus on what I do and less on what I believe. In other words, I believe orthopraxy is a more sustainable, more honest, and more inviting approach to religious and spiritual practice than orthodoxy. 

As a Christian, I have long had a troubled relationship with what I perceived to be too much of a focus of various denominations on believing the right thing. In recent years, I was able to discover Christians who similarly embrace their skepticism around Biblical stories and the importance of "correct belief".
