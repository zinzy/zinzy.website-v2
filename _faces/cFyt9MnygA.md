I met cFyt9MnygA the way I meet many new queer friends, at a gathering of Queer Salon. I remember very clearly that they took a picture of the two of us by pointing their smartphone at the ceiling, which featured a large mirror. We both look very sweet and innocent in the picture. It was an instant hit.

Over the past few years we've been building our friendship, which is full of loud laughter, hopeful tears, frank talks about substance abuse issues, and a perfect mix of depth and flimsy American cultural references.

They moved back to their home country a while ago, saying "I'd rather deal with the homophobia there than the racism in Amsterdam". I'm continuing to let that sink in.
