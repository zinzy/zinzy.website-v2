I met Anja the way many people do these days: on a [dating app](https://weareher.com/). I was there for the obvious reasons, and she was there because a Twitter ad had distracted her from the reason she usually visited Twitter: to rant about sexism and racism.

The story of how we met has two deliciously distinct perspectives: I was bored, lonely, and mischievous, Anja browsed around for twelve minutes before seeing my profile picture and thinking calmly "okay, she is the one".

That was early 2016, and Anja has been my life partner ever since. She's hilarious, compassionate, true, gorgeous, the sweetest dog mom, and so, so many other things.
