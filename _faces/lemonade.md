Sometimes I zoom out of the daily reality of my life to remind myself that I hate dogs. I've always hated dogs. I hate all dogs except corgis. On top of all of these strong feelings, I'm a cat person. All of this goes to show how peculiar it is that Anja and I adopted a dog in February of 2023.

It wasn't a straightforward tale, either. The thought of bringing home a dog hadn't ever entered my mind. When Anja casually mentioned she liked the way a particular dog looked that she noticed in the street, and when I said "wtf why are you looking at dogs?!" and she said "I don't know, I could see us with a dog in the future" and I said "who _are_ you even anymore?!", I considered my future with her. 

But, you know, five minutes of semi-awkward small talk about a pregnant dog between Anja and her therapist later, and here we are. Lemonade, Lemonade, Lemonade. I didn't think I'd have it in me. 

Lemonade has been the central topic in my diary's archive at least between February and April of 2023. If you don't like dog stuff, just skip that part. Or maybe don't ever even return. I don't know when I'll stop writing about her. 

She's a mix between her Pembroke mother and her Cardigan father, and so far she takes strongly after her father. She sleeps a lot, and when she doesn't, she is curious, playful, cuddly, and an all-round friendly super star.
