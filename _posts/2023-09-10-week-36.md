- IT IS HOT STOP CLIMATE CHANGE NOW. I don't think I've seen hotter days this year than week 36. Getting out of a hot shower and feeling equally wet fifteen minutes later. Lemonade barely wanting to walk outside. The sun beaming so feriously we can't keep the windows open. Thank you, Jesus, but please make it cooler.
- There's something sweet about seeing Amsterdam through the eyes of friends from abroad. On Tuesday, I couldn't have been more excited to welcome my [Vine & Fig friends](https://vineandfig.co/) Pickles and Patrick to the city. They're two Irish Catholic gay men named Patrick, so we try to make it work any way we can.
- I was saddened by the fact that Jacob, Patrick's husband, couldn't make it because he had to stay home and help their dog Jude recover from surgery. All week, I felt like we were missing a limb.
- I joined the V&F leadership team in mid 2020, and we've been growing a friendship since. The moment I saw them I knew we were going to get along perfectly in real life, too. Finally getting to embrace them felt like to most natural thing in the world.
- Their AirBnb, which is located just off of Vijzelgracht, was absolutely ridiculous. A three-bedroom penthouse overlooking De Pijp, enormous backyard below, include Swedish saunas and swimming pools. This is how the other half lives.
- I made time to hang out with the Patricks every day they were here, which took us to sweet places. I took them to [Takeichi](https://takeichi-ramen.eu/), my favorite ramen place where I always order anything but ramen, and to [Studio K](https://studio-k.nu/), where they met Lemonade, who chewed through her leash in what seemed like a quiet moment.
- On Friday, we went cheese and wine tasting at [Abraham Kef in Noord](https://abrahamkef.nl/vestigingen/proeflokaal/). It reminded me of how much I love cheese. It was the first thing I was able to say after I learned to say "momma". I want to make my own cheese.
- After dinner at [Thuskomme](https://thuskomme.nl/) on Saturday we took silly mugshots with my Polaroid camera.
- It is truly wonderful to spend time with the Patricks, with whom I weave in and out of conversation topics like it's nobody's business. One minute we're talking about sex toys, and the next about the Book of Job. Knowing they were going to be leaving made me cry a little bit, but then I remembered our friendship had survived without physical get-togethers for three years already.
- On Friday, I met with Mpho to chat church business. I've been discerning all Summer about how I would want to be involved in the church now that it's becoming a church plant, and I decided maintaining the website and social media was a commitment I could make. 
- On Sunday, All Saints held her homecoming gathering after the Summer break. Kyle Rader, our new minister, was there for the first time. I liked the elder millennial vibe he brings to the service. It was intimate and lovely, although I seriously missed the pianist. After the service, we gathered for a potluck dinner in the bishop's garden next to the church. I showed the logo ideas I had been working on, to friendly compliments.
