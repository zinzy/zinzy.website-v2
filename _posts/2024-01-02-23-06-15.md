I edit my biography in a community app for Black professionals. Other people use the flags of their heritage, and I decide to do the same. Which one goes first, ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± or ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¹? I was born in the Netherlands, and consider myself not Dutch per se but definitely an Amsterdammer. Truth be told, I've never been to SÃ£o TomÃ© and Principe, and the parent who hails from there left when he was ten. I wonder, brushing my teeth before bedtime, whether it's appropriation for me to use the flag. And then I think of all the brown and Black faces I know, doing just the same, and entirely dignified and correct in doing what they do. It's one of the prices of growing up Black in a white environment: I wonder when I'll stop feeling like _I'm_ the racist.
