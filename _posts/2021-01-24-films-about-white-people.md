Sometimes I  
feel that I am  
a   
bad  
Black  
girl  
because whenever  
my white girlfriend  
and I sift through  
Netflix  
Prime Video  
or anything  
with a reasonable trial  
period  
and she says "let's   
watch this  
movie or that"  
featuring Black stories   
I instead  
elect to watch a white  
narrative  
because it's nice  
to forget   
about   
racism  
and the teacher  
who called me   
a monkey  
and  
the no one  
who called him  
out  
and  
being a bit  
Black  
and being  
a bit  
white
