- If you ever happen to find yourself in the sleepy fishing town of IJmuiden: the fish, service, atmosphere, and cheesecake in the fish restaurant [De Meerplaats](http://www.meerplaats.nl/) are all very pleasant.
- For my birthday, [Erica Bouma](http://www.zinnigverhaal.nl/) gave me _Jesus_ by rebel theologian Hans Küng. It’s a great and easy read — a recommendation for anybody interested in the history of Christianity.
- [_The Son and the Stranger_](http://www.vpro.nl/speel.program.27507738.html) is a beautiful Dutch-language documentary about Daan, a man who, after studying Hebrew in university, converted to the ultra orthodox Jewish faith. Filmmaker Thomas Vroege attempts to understand his motives.
- [_Ghost Shark_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2600742/), in which the translucent, bright blue ghost of a murdered shark jumps up from the smallest water surfaces to eat innocent holiday goers, is the worst worst Syfy-film of 2013. With a comeback from _7th Heaven_‘s youngest daughter. Totally worth the choke by laughter, though.
- I think Noah Kalina’s photo series [_Internet/Sex (2007-2009)_](http://noahkalina.com/36/39#1) is something very special.
- My poet friend Jelmer van Lenteren runs a very nice [Tumblr](http://ikzitookop.tumblr.com/), where he shares his beautiful work and many great music tips.
