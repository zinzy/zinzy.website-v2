My better judgement to the contrary, admitting to people in the real world that I maintain a personal website always feels like I'm admitting to being a furry on the weekends. Not to kink-shame anyone here. Perhaps it's the provincial, pedestrian childhood I had, but *Jambers*, the Flemish show in which Paul Jambers interviewed cabinet of curiosities, has been edged deeply into my memory and I suspect that of many other millennials.
