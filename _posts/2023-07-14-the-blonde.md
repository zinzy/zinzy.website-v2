At the end of the shopping street  
for people who look like  
they do in the magazines  
there’s a blonde marching in place waiting  
for the light to turn green.  
She is not running per se, rather  
she’s hinting at running.  
Selling it, the way  
Charlize Theron sells  
a night to remember in a perfume commercial  
with next to nothing for evidence.  

Me, a tired mother,  
and a tennis player with wet hair  
stare at the blonde,  
one more covertly than  
the others.  
I know not to tilt my head  
when encounting something  
in which the world tells me  
I will never see myself.

There are so many things  
that are perfect  
about the blonde that I  
get dizzy counting.  
Even a thigh gap as big as hers  
wouldn't be able to hold  
all the details.

At this point, the length,  
and the waviness, and the glossiness,  
and the readiness of her hair  
are just a complete unnecessity.  

We all hate her, the blonde.  
Me, a tired mother,  
and a tennis player with wet hair.  
We hate her because  
of all the little things  
the world has denied us  
the words to articulate.  

We all hate her, the blonde,  
and the blonde hates herself  
a little, too,  
for reasons so bafflingly  
unimportant to us  
she could die from jealousy.
