- Updated the general UI of this website by adding a softer background color 
- Added a [splice method I used earlier](https://github.com/zinzy/zinzy.website/blob/6b0d3cf68e30b2c6d38e81dc3b3d7f4517d44913/_layouts/index.html) to [photo posts](https://indieweb.org/photo), which allows me to alter the size of the images served through Cloudinary
- Merged `_notes` contents into my `_posts` folder so that my dated content is organized in a single place (this is convenient for pagination purposes)
- Styled the [tags page](/tags)
- Updated layout of an individual tag page so that short notes and posts are grouped accordingly
