New Year's Eve is sweet. I spent the morning at Coffee Company Oosterdok working on my website. The girl barista and the guy who came to take over her shift are apparently dating. He's got a full mullet and a geeky mustache. It's that season of fashion again. He was the type of soft masculine only Gen Z-ers can be. At 36, I seem to be developing a habit of noticing how much I'm no longer an 18-year-old. Everyone who seems my age addresses me with the formal "u". I also saw S in the street. It's the first anniversary of her father's passing and she was wondering out loud what could properly trigger an ugly cry. She offered me a red velvet "oliebol", which looked like a fried dog treat. No thank you, ma'am. A friendly face in the neighborhood knocks on our window and tells me she has enjoyed getting to know us a little more, and that she hopes to be in touch more in 2024. 6pm and pizzas enter the oven. It took only 15 minutes for us to finally get into _Better Call Saul_. I expect I won't even make it until midnight. Happy New Year!
