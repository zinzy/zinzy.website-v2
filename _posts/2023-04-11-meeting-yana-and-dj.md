What I love most about today's snapshot is the despair I can see in Lemonade's eyes even when her entire body is a background blur. DJ is a calm 12-year-old dog, and Lemonade was thrilled to see another dog in our home for the first time, but her energy level was high enough that I eventually brought her back to her crate. It was right in time, too, because the afternoon light filling the living room made for a nice little portrait.

It was wonderful to welcome Yana into our home for the first time. When I hired her in the late Winter of 2022 as our newest UX designer, I knew there was something special about her. Now, well over a year later, I'm pleased to call her a friend. We caught up on career adventures, new trends in the design industry, and of course the joys of being a dog mom.

After Yana and DJ left, Anja and I began winding down for the day. After dinner, we watched the latest episode of the final season of _Succession_, which may have been my favorite one yet. The characters on this show are so complex and candidly-written. I'm already low-key heartbroken that this show is going to end. At the same time, I'm also pleased to be alive to watch it unfold in real time.
