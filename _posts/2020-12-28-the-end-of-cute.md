I have a friend  
who is so mad  
at the pandemic  
that he went on  
a six-day crack bender  
just to prove it  
"I've deleted the numbers  
of all my dealers
as well as the  
man who changed my mind"  
he tells me  
His eyes reflect a me  
judging him for him  
and I am  
I have deleted numbers  
deleted apps  
food  
versions of my  
self  
myself  
"Also I saw your  
childhood  
friend on an  
escort  
website  
She's presenting  
as male again"
