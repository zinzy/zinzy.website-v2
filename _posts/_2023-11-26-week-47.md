- It's curious to see my response to a bout of Covid is not much different from what it was in early 2020. The entire week I had to remind myself that, given the regulations, I didn't _have_ to quarantine. Nevertheless, Anja and I were both too ill to do much of anything. I worked half days, spent most of them in bed. Today on Sunday, what's left is a stuffy nose and some fatigue. God, I hope I don't develop long Covid. 
- Watched season two of _Somebody Somewhere_, and regained a few appreciation for Bridget Everett. The new-sincerity, small-life narratives she crafts are mesmerizing.
- Changed my website a little bit, starting it off with a single page of text with links, leaving out a menu altogether. Sometimes, I feel bad that I don't take screenshots every time I change it. But I suppose my continuous redesign strategy prevents that from being realistic. 
- Later in the week, I had cabin fever that was so intense it made me cry in the park a little bit. 
- On Wednesday, the country had her very own 2016 election result: after 20 years of being (rightfully) ridiculed as a far right party, PVV is finally the biggest with 37 of 150 seats in the House. Most people in my safe, progressive, friendly Amsterdam that I've spoken with are gobsmacked. A part of me is angry and sad, but a much larger part says: welcome to my world.
