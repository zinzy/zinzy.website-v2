Sometimes, when bad news arrives, I think to myself "argh, just when I was beginning to think life was nice and steady!" Today is one of those days. I'm immediately thrown off, though mostly by the scenarios playing out in my head. Not because of the particular fact of which I learn.

I'm disappointed by the rediscovery of life's unsteadiness. At the same time, there's beauty to be found. After all, there have been times in my life when I've been so anxious that bad news wasn't an interruption, but a confirmation of what I already thought I knew.

Today, a cloud blocks the sun. I remind myself that it's a whole lot better than rain all year round.
