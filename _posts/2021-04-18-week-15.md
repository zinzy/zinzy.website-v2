I am on a 33-day streak picking my teeth before bed. I've designed a temptation bundle, pairing the activity with a few minutes of garbage television. During these days, I've made it through two seasons of _Love After Lockup_ and six seasons of _Sister Wives_. It shouldn't surprise you that my watching habit has extended well beyond the time it takes me to pick my teeth. Earlier this week I decided to tone it down and return the temptation bundle to its original intention. Not because I want to watch less garbage television, but because I don't want _Sister Wives_ to end.

I watched the trailer for _[Them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WL3Jz8fDgFI)_ and it didn't take long for me to decide I wasn't going to watch the series, despite how much I love Lena Waithe. People who are close to me know this already, but the classroom scene could have been taken from my life. I think I'm ready for [Black narratives that don't _just_ center around the entertainment of collective and private trauma of Black people](https://audacity.substack.com/p/reality-is-horror-enough).

We're in the process of perfecting our tossed pasta recipe.
