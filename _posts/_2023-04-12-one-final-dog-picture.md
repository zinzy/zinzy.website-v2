Okay, here's a promise: now that I'm slowly settling into a daily publishing practice, I'm going to refrain from posting any more dog pictures for the time being. One of the benefits of writing daily is that, over time, it helps me build a nuanced picture of what my life is like, and do so in public. I've been enjoying writing and adding a daily snapshot to my little stories.

Since mid-February, a fair part of my life has revolved around getting a dog. While I love that, and I've received multiple messages from people who enjoy seeing this type of stuff in their RSS feed, I also feel that it's time for something different. The cuteness overload leaves little room for everything else that's going on in my life: I'm in the midst of a big transition professionally, I've been reading lots of poetry lately, and I have plenty of adventures with friends that I haven't been talking about.

I'll do my best to put my Lemonade material in the place I originally created for it: her [weeknotes blog](https://lemonade.waleson.us/). And to all the dog haters out there: a sincere apology, I know how you feel, I don't like dogs either except for Lemonade.
