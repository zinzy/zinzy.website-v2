Today, Lemonade and I visited [Studio Pansa Amstel](https://www.studiopansa.com/studio-pansa-amstel), where Anja has spent the last seven Sundays learning how to work a ceramics wheel. It's quite the adventure for her, and I love seeing her dive into a new field that's so different from her day-to-day life and work. Their motto is "dirty hands, clear mind", and that certainly seems to be the case for Anja.

I saw dozens of gorgeous little cups in the making, each with a unique maker's mark and the intricate details only found in things that were crafted by hands. I think I'll sign up for one of Pansa's courses myself some day.
