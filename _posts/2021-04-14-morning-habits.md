One thing I appreciate is my growing ability to understand how small choices affect the quality of my day. I have a history of struggling with doing things that are good for me, and while I've always known that certain things have a more positive influence than others, I wasn't always able to execute on them.

Lately, I've been tinkering with the way I organize my mornings. I've come to understand that, in order for me to have a good day, I need to incorporate, in this particular order:

- Get up within 30 minutes of my first alarm going off
- Carry out a skin care routine I never thought I would be interested in
- Get out of the house within 30 minutes of me getting out of bed
- Walk for one hour
- Empty my Omnifocus inbox during this walk
- Arrive home and update YNAB
- Plan my day
- Empty my email inbox
- Make a smoothie
- Start my daily meetings
