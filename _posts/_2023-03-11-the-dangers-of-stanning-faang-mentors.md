This morning, [Adrianna Tan](https://tech.lgbt/@skinnylatte@hachyderm.io/110003108899542385) was in my timeline talking about the fact that, against their better judgement, her tech peers are still drinking the [Big Tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech) Kool-Aid. It's a paradox in which we all perpetually find ourselves: we're all fully aware of the known dangers of its monopolistic tactics, yet the ubiquitousness of Big Tech keeps us from walking our talk.

Far, far removed from the realities of Silicon Valley, I, too, engage with this paradox every day, both in my personal and my professional life. In the latter, UX mentoring best embodies this difficult relationship. If you're in the tech industry, I don't have to tell you how popular UX mentoring is these days.

## UX mentoring in 2023
Not entirely new but definitely spiking in popularity these last few years, UX mentoring is a great way for many designers to learn and grow. Many of the designers I've worked with have received great support when preparing for job interviews, tackling challenges at work, and brushing up their skills.

This democratization of design knowledge is beautiful and heart-warming. I know of warm friendships that have formed between a mentor and a mentee, of designers landing their dream job, and of seemingly unsolvable problems finally getting tackled because of a good mentoring session.

Mentoring platforms have popped up in many different corners of the internet, and more and more designers are calling themselves mentors. A person with 20 years of experience would make a great mentor, but so could a person who joined the industry a year ago. Everybody has a story to tell.

## FAANG as evangelists for best practices
As it goes in any part of Western culture, brand recognition equals legitimacy. The more well-known a designer's company name is, the earlier people start calling themselves a mentor. The more well-known a designer's company name is, the more attractive they are as a mentor. After all, successful companies must use successful tactics, and who better to teach you about those tactics than the people who work for such companies?

## FAANG is not a pars pro toto
I'm a designer specialized in enterprise SaaS products and this is where a problem starts to emerge. The work I do in the type of companies that usually hire me, is far removed from the Big Tech companies with distributed teams of 1,000+ designers. The challenges that come with the enterprise SaaS territory are often so different from those existing in Big Tech companies that it's easy for things to get lost in translation.

FAANG companies, while impactful and no doubt succesful at achieving particular results, are not a _pars pro toto_, a part to represent the whole of the tech industry. 


## Doing the right thing vs. doing the thing right



## Wait, you're not a mentor? How do you call yourself a designer?
