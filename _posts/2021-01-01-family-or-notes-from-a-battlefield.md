As soon as she hands you the gift  
you know it’s another one  
“Trans Life Survivors”  
says the cover  
“Merry Christmas!”  
says your sister  
you have only been using  
they/them pronouns  
in private  
for a year or so  
it’ll look so beautiful next to  
the ex-gay book  
your other sister presented to you  
on your birthday last month  

At family dinner you  
spend bathroom breaks in your  
childhood bedroom  
five in total  
logging on to talk to us  
about how the heavy things feel  
being the punching bag  
on which your 11-year-old cousin  
practises her right hook  
screaming fire about  
her trans classmate  
stings  
and  
it stings  
like a shattered jaw  

Your father-in-law planned a  
Christmas pub crawl of sorts  
Covid-style  
each of the siblings hosting  
the entire family  
for a portion of the day  
hopping from house to house  
eating, drinking, loving the way only  
a big family will  
At the fourth stop you are full  
zonking off into the distance  
catching the smiling face of your  
sister-in-law on the way there  
and you remember what  
it felt like when  
she wouldn’t come to
your lesbian wedding  

For you and them  
there is no Family  
not since you came out as non-binary  
and your parents  
yelled  
“check please”  
the only trace of  
those you came from  
is the card your grandmother sent  
She writes “I wanted you to  
know I support you”  
She is a sweetheart  
it is a teardrop in the desert  
that you cling to  

Your father was no exception  
first the pandemic  
now the respirator  
the store has been extra busy these days  
but you’re getting by  
it’s keeping your mind off  
of how much he was hoping  
you’ll find a girl someday soon  
Today, the phone call  
from the hospital  
lets you know that  
he can come home for Christmas  
The disappointment you feel  
sits in your body like a monster  

You have all the time in the world  
to tell me how you’re doing  
but not a moment to yourself  
to commit to the act  
with all those relatives in the house  
prone to restricting themselves to  
those parts of the Bible  
that make Christianity look easy  
and you being back  
in the home of your youth  
after the attempt  
confirms what you fear and  
what your parents have been saying  
is true about your life  
“I have no love for the gays in my heart”  
your father said  
You wonder how gay  
he knows you are  
I wonder where you’ve hidden  
the Pride flag that I sent you  
as a housewarming gift  

Colossians 3:26 The freedom of HaShem is the wisdom to decide who is truly your sister, your brother, your father, your mother. Don’t let the bastards grind you down.
