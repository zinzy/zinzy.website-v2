I love this essay, Simone. Fully embracing the very IndieWeb concept of a personal website has helped me shake this feeling of FOMO, I imagine the same way it did for you. Don't be hard on yourself, though, we all fell for this concept, and many of us still do. If society presents something as a way to solve a problem, most people will eventually try it. And while it does solve _some_ problems, it also creates others. I have a few Gen Z friends who never fail to make me feel old whenever they talk about "their personal brand" in an unironic way. Gives me the shivers.
