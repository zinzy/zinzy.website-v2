Dreamed I had the opportunity to develop a close friendship with Laura Linney, but we were in my childhood bedroom which was covered in Laura Linney posters for the purpose of this dream, and it made her consider me more of a fan than a friend, and she went to befriend my mother instead. Horrible in all ways imaginable.
