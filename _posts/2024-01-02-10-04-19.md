Hey dear Desi, a bit late, but as promised, here are some resources that may be helpful when diving deeper into UX:

- _Don't Make Me Think_, _The Design of Everyday Things_, and _100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know About People_ are books most UXers would recommend. In addition, [Interaction Design Foundation has a great overview of books](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/ux-design-books-guide).
- [The Guide to Design](https://start.uxdesign.cc/) by uxdesign.cc is a great starting point
- Career Foundry has a nice overview of [How to become a UX designer](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-become-a-ux-designer/)
- [UX Matters](https://www.uxmatters.com/) is perhaps my favorite resource on UX topics 
- [UX Research Field Guide](https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide) by UserInterviews.com. It focuses purely on research practice, but it's a comprehensive overview of all things involved in focusing on the U in UX.
