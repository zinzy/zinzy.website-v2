- The first week back at work is fairly quiet, I even found myself on the verge of boredom at one point. Organically, this makes me feel bad, but I remind myself that weeks before and after holidays tend to have this effect on my life. I tell myself I'm just landing.
- No one can convince me the municipality of Amsterdam *isnâ€™t* using major construction projects to show tourists how crap the city can be. On Sunday, I go for a long bike ride to Amsterdamse Bos and back, and crossing the Berlagebrug I'm struck by how quiet the street is without cars racing by. I like it.
- I finished watching _[[The Righteous Gemstones]]_, and I miss them already. 
- Anja's still off for the summer, and I'm watching her slowly recover from being my personal chauffeur for two weeks
- The Summer makes me not want to cook. It's no help that I'm using [Annelie](https://anneliewambeek.com/)'s apartment to work while she's travelling, and that I use the occasion to order poke bowls for lunch. I'm surprised by the quality of [Poke Perfect](https://pokeperfect.nl/en/amsterdam/linnaeusstraat/)'s teriyaki chicken bowl, extra edamame. 
- I'm reading and enjoying Robin Meyer's _[[Saving Jesus From the Church]]_, a tool to make my interest in [[orthopraxy]] more tangible.
