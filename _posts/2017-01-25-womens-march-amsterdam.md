Proudly nasty, I joined Anja, my mother-in-law Sauci, and millions of others around the world last Saturday to attend the [Women's March](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Women%27s_March). Museum Square in Amsterdam was full of pussy hats, face paint, smiling faces, and righteous indignation.

I don't often attend protests, not in the last place because I'm cautious about negative media outlets that often ridicule protesters, but I loved being a part of this day. I have no idea what's in store with this American presidency, but I imagine it can't be very positive. I feel fortunate to live in a place that lends itself well to such protests. It makes me feel less scared and less alone.

What a time to be alive.
