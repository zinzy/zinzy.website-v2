This is a [Now](https://nownownow.com/) page. It contains what I'd tell a friend I hadn't seen in a year. I'm using it as a casual version of an about page. You should make a Now page for yourself.

### I'm Zinzy Waleson Geene, I'm in my mid-thirties and I have a penchant for casual web publishing
This website is a digital living room; a place where I think aloud, change my mind, and share slices of life. I think the Internet is a miraculous place, and believe we all have the right to own our stuff, and do so in a sustainable way. I suppose this means I like [IndieWeb principles](https://indieweb.org/principles).

### I live in Amsterdam's finest neighborhood: de Indische Buurt.
I share my life with [Anja Waleson](https://anjawaleson.notion.site/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55), a high school English teacher and new ceramics enthusiast. We live in a little shoebox with a petit garden. We're companions to puppy Lemonade, who may or may not have her own blog, [let's find out together](https://lemonade.waleson.us).

### In my spare time I enjoy swimming, writing, making music, and painting
With generous donations from friends, I bought myself a piano for my birthday last year. It's a journey of rediscovering how I best learn, of what draws my attention, and of how music is the best mental health item in my toolbox. For entirely archival reasons, I'm making a little EP with self-written songs this Summer.

Aside from music, I like to spend time writing, drawing, visiting the theatre, and swimming. With the puppy it's a bit of an adventure, but I'm hoping to settle back into my 6:30AM morning swim routine. I've missed swimming plenty over the winter, and it might be smart to find a good indoor pool for the later months of 2023. For now, I'm pleased to know that Amsterdam's finest outdoor pool is in our own backyard.

### I'm embarking on a new professional adventure
After 2.5 years with the wonderful team of [Leeruniek](https://leeruniek.nl/) I joined [Gerimedica](https://gerimedica.nl/) in May. Onboarding there has been an absolute dream, and I've felt a part of the family since the moment I signed the contract. I've been given plenty of space to roam around, which means that I was able to hit the ground running, teaming up with my buddy Hans to improve not only product design, but also research and evangelism.

### I'm mentoring again
After a hiatus, I'm pleased to be back on the mentoring market. With 16 years of professional experience, I've found that my stories, many of which I had always deemed irrelevant to the world, can be of help to other people in the IT industry, specifically UX designers and researchers and product managers. If you'd like to book a session with me, you may do so via [ADPList](https://adplist.org/mentors/zinzy-nev-geene).

### I'm doing my best to accept the ebb and flow of life
One of the thinking traps in which I routinely fall is the one where "Y can happen when X is completed". We make a plan and God laughs. I've found that meditation helps me break this cycle. I've been devoting time daily to a meditation session. It's becoming easier to remember that even 10 minutes of practice is worthwhile, even when I keep comparing myself to monks on some Tibetan mountain.

### I'm learning how to be kind to my neurodivergent brain
Through trial and error, I'm finding ways to help myself best learn and deliver. One thing that's been helpful in this regard is accepting my tendency to think top-down rather than bottom-up. It's marvellous to see how much of the world assumes a bottom-up approach to learning, communicating, and creating. YouTuber [Elizabeth Filips](https://www.youtube.com/@elizabethfilips) has been of great help on this journey.
