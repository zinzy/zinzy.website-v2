The men's liberation movement came on my radar in recent years as a healthy way of approaching the topic of The Patriarchy™. It's a growing, diverse movement of people who criticize and question the surprisingly narrow boxes in which our societies tend to put men. When I got acquainted with [[standpoint theory]], two things dawned on me:

1. Unlike what I've been taught — and what I in turn began to teach myself — cisgender, heterosexual, able-bodied, able-minded, educated, non-poor white men do not have a monopoly on the truth
2. Western societies (and perhaps others, too) perpetuate that misconception at the expense of not only everyone who is not a cisgender, heterosexual, able-bodied, able-minded, educated, non-poor white man, but also at the expense of everyone who is

I appreciate how the men's liberation movement learns from existing feminist frameworks about equality, dignity, and emancipation. Not because "finally men are learning from women", but because it opens up a conversation that I didn't think possible until the birth of this movement.
