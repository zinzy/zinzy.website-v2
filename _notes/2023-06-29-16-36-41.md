Hey [Elliott](https://elliott.computer/), so lovely to have you over for coworking this afternoon! I love the way you think about UX; your artistic perspective is so valuable for the Internet and for web design, and you always make me see things from a new angle. Aside from the links I already shared with John and Maarten on [June 23rd](/2023-06-23-14-00-00), here's some stuff I love:

- [Jason Cosper](https://jason.cosper.me/) inspired me to get rid of my About page.
- [Agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/) and [Scrum](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum) are quite complex, and multi-interpretable, but [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/lean-ux-agile-study-guide/) has a few nice resources.
- When it comes to extraversion and "people-person"-ness, I think the UX industry is quite a good fit for those who aren't those things. Like I said, your ability to create an icebreaker on the fly isn't half as interesting as your ability to figure out what UX method can answer a specific question. This reminds me of [a talk I attended at UXInsights Festival 2022](https://vimeo.com/719000396/65193d4f26), which wasn't about this topic per se, but about making UX research accessible for neurodivergent UX professionals. You might like it!
