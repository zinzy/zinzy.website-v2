Hello, I'm [[About|Zinzy Waleson]]!

I love the intersection of design, research, and strategy, and I also love cooking, making music, yoga, reading, and cinema.

I enjoy meeting new people. If you have something to share, you'd like to play or learn together, or can think of any othe reason we should be talking, get in touch with me. This is my [hello](https://alastairjohnston.com/introducing-hello-pages/) page, where you can learn how I like to keep in touch. 

How to contact me:
- Some of your answers might be found on my [[faq]] page.
- For any inquiry, email is your best shot. Please use my [[contact|contact form]].
- I infrequently check [Mastodon](https://mstdn.social/@zinzy) because I like things that are decentralized. 
- If you'd like to schedule mentor time with me, check my [[mentoring]] page (I'm currently on hiatus from it)
- I do not use social media. Any account in my name that you may find is not in use, so feel safe assuming I won't see your message, and I won't receive a notification of it.
