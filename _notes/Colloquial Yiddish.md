Currently making my way through _Colloquial Yiddish_.

### Unpolished study notes

Yiddish knows three main dialects as well as a formalized language:
- Northeastern or Lithuanian Yiddish
- Central or Polish Yiddish
- Ukrainian Yiddisk
- Standard Yiddish originated in the 20th century, largely based on the pronunciation of Northeastern Yiddish, while retaining some pronunciation from the other two

The Yiddish alphabet consists of the Hebrew letters already known to me, with a few notable differences:
- The diacritic niqqud signs used both in Hebrew learning materials isn't used in Yiddish, aside from a number of signs used to distinguish between various pronunciations of the same letter. For me, it's more straightforward than the fairly intricate niqqud system.

Some notes on script and pronunciation:
- The *yud* neighboring vowels is a `j`, otherwise as an `i`
- Much like Hebrew, Yiddish uses a *shtumer alef* as a booster seat for vowels at the beginning of a work
- *Chirek yud* helps distinguish between the `i` and `j` sounds, so that Yiddish can be spelled _יידיש_.
