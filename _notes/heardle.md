# Heardle
The tagline of [Heardle](https://heardle.app) should be: "wow, though, music, huh?"

I was introduced to Heardle by Anja, who it from The Roxane Gay Agenda. If you're not familiar with it, Heardle is a web-based game that allots a player six attempts to guess a song. It's Wordle for music. I've been playing Heardle since the day I met it. I currently hold a 75% success rate. I'm not strong on pop music from the past five years.

What I find utterly endearing about Heardle, is that it's not a game. Heardle is an ode to music.
