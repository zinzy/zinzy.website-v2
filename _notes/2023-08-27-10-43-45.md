I've updated some things around here over the weekend that I think are worth documenting. There are three major changes:
- Status update at the top of the page
- Content is now served through a submodule
- [Blogroll](/blogroll)

I love [Mu-An](https://muan.co/)'s status update so much I had to have it for myself. I like the idea of fleeting messages, blurbs shouted into space, with no proper archive. I almost fool myself into thinking nobody will be able to hold me accountable for what I publish there, but we all know that's not true.

I enjoy writing [[Densely-linked content]], and for this reason it's better for me to have all of my writing in a single space. My space of choice at the moment is [[Obsidian]], and thanks to [Github Publisher](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/obsidian-github-publisher), an Obsidian plugin, and Tania Rascia's [sweet writeup on submodules](https://www.taniarascia.com/git-submodules-private-content/), I now technically don't have to be in my code base to publish content anymore. 

I've taking the liberty of hacking together the most obscene of deployment strategies: every time I update my status, Netlify builds my site and checks the latest updates of the submodule, publishing any new notes, posts, or pages in the process. I am not ashamed.
