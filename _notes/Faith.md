This is a #MOC. 

Like many people on this earth, I've struggled to find ways to relate to Christianity in a way that is authentic, inclusive, and trauma-informed. While I wasn't raised in a Bible-thumping environment, I've been on a deconstruction journey since I was 14. 

I believe that  [[What we do trumps what we believe]], that [[Jesus is my teacher, not my savior]], and [[I take the Bible too seriously to take it literally]].
