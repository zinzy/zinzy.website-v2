- I'm at Leeruniek building a sustainable design and product practice
- Reading Zadie Smith's _On Beauty_, enjoying it so far
- Building a sustainable meditation practice by engaging in daily unguided sessions (which, as it turns out, is a lot more relaxing than finding the perfect guided meditation on the perfect app)
- Training my product management muscle by having difficult internal conversations about priorities
- Thoroughly enjoying mentoring on ADPList.
