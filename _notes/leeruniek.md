# Leeruniek
Since late 2020 I've been a part of the wonderful team of Leeruniek, a scale-up in education technology that was founded in 2015. 

I joined Leeruniek predominantly because I liked the things they told me about using data for good, and working autonomously in a design-forward product team.

## Why I love working at Leeruniek
- We operate from a standpoint of generous assumptions
- Employees are invited to be proactive and autonomous
- The product team is integrated, and tight-knit
