I believe Jesus is a person who was born, lived, and died at one point in history, and that he inspired those around him. I consider his virgin birth, practice of miracles, physical resurrection, ascension into heaven, or position as the son of God to be irrelevant to my faith. 

On his behalf, without holding this against any one person in particular, I am offended by the idea that, without these "unbelievable" aspects of his story, Jesus is not worth our time. I find the transactional relationship between Jesus and humans (we owe him pure belief because of what he did for us, and only if we believe, we will go to heaven) to be problematic. I seek to learn from Jesus because I think he provides a beautiful, partially unoriginal ethical framework. Given the culture in which I grew up, this framework is what makes me feel most at home of all the religious concepts at my disposal.

I use the word "Christian" begrudgingly when referring to myself, because I do consider Jesus my savior.
