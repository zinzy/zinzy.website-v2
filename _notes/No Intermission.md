excerpt: "I attended Marina Abramović's show in Carré in October of 2022."

There is very little about Marina Abramović that is not awe-inducing. For one of her early works, _Rhythm 0_{% marginfigure 'mf-id-whatever' 'https://res.cloudinary.com/dbi2zounq/image/upload/c_scale,w_1200/v1667834197/zinzy.website/marina-abramovic-rhythm-0.png' 'Abramović during  _Rhythm 0_, with a loaded gun in her left hand, pointing at her head.' %}, she stood in a room for six hours, next to a table with 72 objects, all of which the audience was free to use on her in whichever way they saw fit. She has developed an excellent [[Marina Abramović Method|method]] that is helping me meditate in a more creative way. At MoMa, she celebrated her retrospective by performing _[The Artist is Present](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/964)_, she spent months at a table gazing into the eyes of strangers, never getting up. Her fifty-year tenure as one of the world's leading performance artists has inspired countless people and she has let performance art reach far beyond the invisible but sturdy boundaries of high-brow art.

I remember how casual I felt about having obtained tickets for _No Intermission_ at Carré. I knew of Marina, and Anja sure was excited (she has been trying to find a torrented version of the nowhere-to-be-found documentary _The Artist is Present_ for weeks now, with no success), and I even took the time to research her work a bit{% sidenote 'Flickr series' 'MoMA has [a wonderful Flickr series](https://www.flickr.com/photos/themuseumofmodernart/albums/72157623741486824) showcasing the people who sat across from Marina during _The Artist is Present_' %}. I didn't at all understand what I was to expect, and true to form I met that lack of understanding with a lack of true enthusiasm.

Nevertheless, I did join Anja in showing up extra early, and so at 10 A.M. on a Saturday, we were the first in line for Marina's 12-hour group perfomance show.

### Performers
The event was kicked of by Marina, who taught a one-hour workshop on her [[Marina Abramović Method|method]]. After that, we were free to roam Carré for eleven hours, where ten performance artists were scattered around the building. We had access to areas usually closed off to the public, which made for an exciting day.

- **[Abel Azcona](https://abelazcona.art/)**  with _La Savia_: having Carré's basement all to himself, Abel had a three-screen installation where the audience simultaneously got acquainted with him narrating his abusive and neglectful childhood, him spacing on heroin, and him prostituting himself for the last time. I was quite late to the party, but apparently he has actually taken heroin in the theatre upstairs as well, and people were taking care of his body. Later, during the afterparty, I complemented him on his work. He gave me a tight embrace and whispered "I love you" in my ear, smelling of whatever he had clearly been drinking extensively. I felt ashamed to learn that I loved his substance abuse, but predominantly as an art form.

- **[Carla Adra](http://carlaadra.com/)** with _The office of tears, the employee_: I only spent a little bit of time looking at Carla. She was stationed in the coat check area, a busy hallway that didn't allow me to concentrate on what she was doing. I saw a few people leave the booth crying with a look of relief on their faces, so I imagine the experience was worthwhile for them. 

- **[Maria Stamenkovic](https://www.stamenkovicherranz.com/)** with _Herranz Building 2_: I didn't pay much attention to this, as it was one of four performance pieces happening in a single space. 
- **[Dante Buu](https://www.dantebuu.com/)** with _in my tongue, I dream of your mouth, my Alexander_: 
- **[Miles Greenberg](https://www.milesgreenberg.com/)** with _Landscape with Figures_: 
- **[Yiannis Pappas](https://yiannispappas.com/)** with _The Revise_: 
- **[Yingmei Duan](https://www.yingmei-art.com/)** with _Yingmei in Wonderland_: 
- **[Maurício Ianês](https://www.instagram.com/mauricioianes)** with _crossfire_: another one of the 
- **[Ana Prvacki](https://anaprvacki.com/)** with _Bee Intense_:
- **[Anthony Hüseyin](https://www.anthonyhuseyin.com/)** with _Everything Sounds Better in the Bathroom_ and _Portable Disco_

### Highlights
At some point during the evening, the anarchy of the afternoon's performances had died down, and the main stage had turned into  Anthony Hüseyin's night club. In the front of the stage, two people positioned two chairs across from each other, and began Abramović's famous gaze. It was fascinating to look at, particularly because of what was happening around them. Slowly, a bigger and bigger crowd began to form behind them, with onlookers eagerly hoping that one of them would get up. 

After a while, though, people began pulling up chairs, reminding me that you can always [[Draw your own shell]].

### My takeaways
- The [[Marina Abramović Method]] is great for connecting with [[Deep knowing]]
- Anthony Hüseyin is an excellent musician
