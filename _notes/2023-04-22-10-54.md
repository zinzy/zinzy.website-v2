I’m now writing these notes using an Apple Shortcut (as inspired by [Mu-An](https://muan.co). It’s a great way to publish IndieWeb content without having to do any special magic. Setting up this posting strategy has helped me evaluate how I handle notes on this website. My writing often contains short, daily reflections, but it may be worthwhile to move that to this section. Then I can reserve the writing area for longer-form content. [Derek Kedziora](https://derekkedziora.com) is great at that, maybe I’ll see if I can be, too.
