# Standard dough
I've discovered that [Julia Turshen's recipe for jam buns](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/raspberry-jam-buns-creme-fraiche-frosting) works with a dough that makes itself useful in a wide variety of other contexts. 

## What I make with this recipe
- Jam buns
- Chocolate buns
- [Challah](/challah)

## Variations I've tried
- Substituting all or half of the butter for olive oil
