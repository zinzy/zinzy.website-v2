Okay listen. I've had dozens of conversations across the span of my life with people who had been to Italy and who — quite snobbishly, if you ask me — told me that Real Italian Pasta™ is made up of only a few ingredients. I've always known they were right. I've also seen this principle used and abused more than I care to remember.

"Less Is More" in cooking is dangerous in the hands of the wrong cook. You know the one. The "I Don't Need A Recipe I've Been Cooking For Half A Century" cook (my mother). The "I'm a Vegetarian and I Keep Things Simply Simple" cook. This recipe is a wonderful reminder that, with cooking, the devil is in the details.

### Ingredients 
  - 1.5 kg of roma (!) tomatoes
  - 3 garlic bulbs (yes)
  - 1 tsp salt
  - 1 tbsp sugar 
  - 3 tbsp olive oil for tomatoes
  - 1 tbsp olive oil for pasta 

### Instructions

  - Heat the oven to 200°C
  - Cut the head (where the clove is attached to the bulb) off all garlic cloves, leaving on the rest of the skin
  - Line a baking sheet with parchment paper so that it sticks up against the walls of the baking sheet (this is needed to keep all the moisture in)
  - Add the roma tomatoes to the baking sheet, pushing them all to one side
  - Spread individual garlic bulbs across the tomatoes
  - Sprinkle tomatoes and garlic cloves evenly with olive oil
  - Toss
  - Spread tomatoes and garlic cloves evenly across the sheet (if you don't, the tomatoes will steam and not roast)
  - Sprinkle with salt and sugar
  - Roast for 20 minutes
  - Bring a large pan of water to a boil
  - After 20 minutes, check and toss, making sure you don't let any liquid spill over the edges of the parchment paper
  - Roast tomatoes and garlic for another 20-30 minutes until the tomatoes and garlic look like they're about to burn
  - Add salt to boiling water
  - Add pasta and cook for the specified time 
  - Once tomatoes and garlic look like they're about to burn, take the baking sheet out of the oven
  - With each individual garlic clove, take the clove and squeeze its butt so that the contents will fall out. Add contents to a separate bowl. Once you've handled all of them, add naked cloves back to the tomatoes.
  - Drain the pasta in a colander, add 1 tbsp of olive oil and toss to prevent sticking. Transfer to a large bowl.
  - Taking three parchment paper corners in one hand, create a little shoot with the remaining corner, and transfer the entire contents of the baking sheet to the bowl with pasta
  - Toss, toss, toss, toss, toss
  - Add some micro basil leaves and parmezzan
  - Serve immediately
