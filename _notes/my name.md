When my mother was pregnant with me, she first decided she was going to name me Chris if I was going to turn out to be a girl, after [Chrissie Hynde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrissie_Hynde) from The Pretenders. Had I been a boy, my name would have been Stevie Wonder.

Upon seeing Nelson Mandela on television, however, she quickly decided she was going to name me after his daughter Zindzi. A white woman pregnant by a Sao Tomean man, she wanted to honor my Africanness by naming me after a South African woman. I also imagine she must have thought the original spelling was too ethnic.
