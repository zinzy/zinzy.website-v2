Hey Desi love, hope you're well! As promised, here's that overview of handy UX things:

- You should sign up for [ADPList](https://adplist.org/), a platform that offers free one-on-one mentoring with all kinds of folks. They have handy filters in place to help you identify the questions you have, and how you can best answer them with a mentor.
- Some thought leaders that I love: [NN Group](https://www.nngroup.com/), [UX Matters](https://www.uxmatters.com/), [St√©phanie Walter](https://stephaniewalter.design/) (specialized in enterprise products like me), [UX Collective](https://uxdesign.cc/), and [UX Planet](https://uxplanet.org/). [Career Foundry](https://careerfoundry.com/) and [Interaction Design Foundation](https://www.interaction-design.org/) have great blog articles as well.
- An example of a designer who knows how to create a good case study is [Buzz Usborne](https://buzzusborne.com/work/)

Let's use tomorrow to go into some more detail about how to put together a portfolio!
