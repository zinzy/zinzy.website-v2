# Frequently Asked Questions
### Things you may want from me

#### I'm thinking of moving into UX. Can we chat?
Sure! Check out my [[mentoring]] page to see if I have any availability.

#### Can you help me with my personal brand / logo / website?
No. While I enjoyed running my own design studio for eight years, my design efforts these days are geared towards tools that people use at work. I can tell you this, though: [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) gives most individual website owners what they need, and if you're a one-person company you don't need a logo.

#### Can I interview you for my podcast?
Probably! I enjoy speaking about my work in design and product, as well as intersectionality, anti-racism, queer Christianity, and what it means to be a queer Afropean Catholic. Send me an [[About|email]] and I'll let you know if I have time.

#### Can you write something for me?
Maybe. On occasion, I write Scripture reflections or essays about queer Catholicism. If you're interested in something like that, email me about your request and let's chat!

### Things about me

#### You call yourself a Product & Design Manager. Are you a designer or a product manager?
Both, but mostly I like to call myself a designer who manages product. I don't see myself ever moving into product management that doesn't involve design expertise. For companies such as [[leeruniek 1]], combining these two roles is a great fit, and I can see the same for many other start-ups and scale-ups.
