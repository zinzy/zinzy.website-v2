# Cohesive colors
In order to achieve a well-balanced color scheme, Erica Schoonmaker introduced [Cohesive Colors](https://dribbble.com/shots/166246-My-Secret-for-Color-Schemes) in a 2016 Dribbble shot. To ensure that a color scheme doesn't consist of both harsh and soft tones, which usually doesn't work outside of [brutalist design](https://brutalistwebsites.com), she overlays a central color on the others with reduced opacity, and chooses the colors that result from it.

I've been using this method for years to create and clean up color libraries. 

I recently learned that Javier Bórquez made a nifty [tool](https://javier.xyz/cohesive-colors/) for it. That's great, because I'd been making screenshots for years, and results varied depending on the environment in which these screenshots were being used. Figma, I'm looking at you.
