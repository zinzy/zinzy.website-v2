Hey Ornella, as promised a small introduction into the world of personal knowledge management (PKM):

- PKM helps us collect, classify, save, search, find, and share information
- By taking atomic notes and densely linking them we can come to new ideas 
- There are many PKM tools available, each very advanced and functionality-rich in their own way
- The easiest, and cheapest, way to get started with PKM is by downloading Obsidian
- You may want to download their [Windows](https://obsidian.md/download) app 
- If you use a cloud service like Dropbox, you can easily back up your notes
- I think you may enjoy [this article on PKM for researchers](https://writingcooperative.com/note-taking-is-not-enough-knowledge-management-for-researchers-and-writers-319acec1fc2e)
