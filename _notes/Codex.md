Inspired by [Buster Benson's _Codex_](https://busterbenson.com/beliefs/), [Greg Clarke](https://gregology.net/codex/), [Elliott Cost's _Opinions_](http://web.archive.org/web/20220123045740/https://elliott.computer/pages/opinion) and others I'm using this page to grow[^1] a record of things I believe.

### Terms of use

#### If you're Zinzy
No human experience can ever be summed up in a list of bullet points. Nevertheless, the things below you have written in earnest. Look at them whenever you need a reminder of what's important to you.

#### If you're someone else
Feel free to read, learn, wonder, and remember:
- Statements below apply to me, and to me only, even though their phrasing is often general
- This is an unapologetic codex, in which I may say things that offend your sensibilities, simply because of the person I am. You are not me, you may disagree with me. That's okay. Make your own codex!
- These things may be subject to change. 

### The codex

- At heart I'm a cultural relativist
- I'm privileged because:
	- I have no serious, untreatable physical disabilities 
	- I live in a North-West European country with solid infrastructure, excellent health care, and good education opportunities, where I mostly feel safe and free presenting as queer with my partner
	- My partner and I are invested in our relationship, share the same values, and have succeeded at cohabitating so far
	- I have close friendships with White people who are fiercely antiracist
- I lack privilege because:
	- I'm a first-generation university graduate, and I was not at all prepared for what academic life would bring
	- I cannot safely travel to certain countries with my partner
	- There are church communities that I cannot join because of the color of my skin, my gender identity, or my sexual orientation.

#### Chapter 3: Spirituality and philosophy
- [[ I take the Bible too seriously to take it literally]]
- [[What we do trumps what we believe]]
- Christian culture is concerned too much with what's to come and not enough with what is
- [[Jesus is my teacher, not my savior]]
- Studying the Bible in its historical, literary, and liturgical context is an important tool to better understand the cultures in which it has become or has been dominant

#### Chapter 4: People & relationships
- People try to do what they think will make the world a better place, even if that means its destruction

#### Chapter 6: Politics and policies
- No political system is flawless, some are worse than others
- Both revolution and evolution are required for change
- Ones politics cannot be seen separately from ones character and conduct. Sometimes, it's not possible to "engage with someone despite your different views", because of the implications those views have
- Abortion and birth control should be easily accessible to every human on earth
