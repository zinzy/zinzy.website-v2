# Weeknotes for week 16, 2022
Each year I'm less embarrassed to say it: I don't like that stretch of time during the Dutch Springtime when no work week is normal. Aside from the usual Christian holidays there's King's Day and Liberation Day, and I've found it really messes with my head. I don't mind them much looking ahead (like I did [[weeknotes-2|last week]]), but having to live through it could well be too much for me. 

This week, I learn that bolognese is a great base for chili, as long as you add enough cumin, beef, and beer. We watch _[[the-undoing|The Undoing]]_, which is a surprisingly great decision of Hugh Grant.
