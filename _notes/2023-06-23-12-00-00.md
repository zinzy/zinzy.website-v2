Hey [John](https://www.jboy.space/) and [Maarten](https://murb.nl/), thanks for meeting me for coffee! I loved nerding out with you two about IndieWeb stuff, personal sites, the red ThinkPad belly button, and what personal web projects we're working on. As promised, here's a list of things I wanted to share with you:

- A few IndieWeb people I like (who are involved in the community in various degrees) are [Simone Silverstroni](https://simonesilvestroni.com/), [Manuel Moreale](https://manuelmoreale.com/), [Mu-An Chiou](https://muan.co/), [Derek Kedziora](https://derekkedziora.com/), and [Elliott Cost](https://elliott.computer/), the latter two of whom live in Amsterdam as well.
- The friendly PhD candidate we met is [Ornella Porcu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ornella-porcu-5aa20119).

I'll spend some time in the next few weeks cleaning up my site. I'll probably also try to establish some form of digital garden again.
