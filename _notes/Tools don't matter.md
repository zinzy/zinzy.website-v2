[Dan Russell told Lifehacker](https://lifehacker.com/im-dan-russell-google-research-scientist-and-this-is-1450690468) almost a decade ago:

I'm yet to convince myself that is a bad idea. In my journey as a human with a personal computer, I've come to prefer platform- and application-agnostic computing over anything else. Sure, I have my preferences, but I don't want any long-term engagement with products that force me to limit my opportunities.

### Tools don't matter means:
- I focus my attention on an object, not on the tool I can use to manipulate it (example: I keep a large collection of plain text files in my [[second brain]]. Over the years, I've used countless apps to manipulate these files.)
- With analog writing, rather than fixing myself to a particular method of archiving, or a set of writing tools (which is what a part of me desperately needs) I mix up where and how I write.
- I don't use desktop or smartphone apps that require me to export my data  and back it up independently (example: Evernote, Moodnotes)
