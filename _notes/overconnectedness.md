# Overconnectedness
A state that develops when I'm so well-exposed to the every-day lives of other people that I not only lose my curiosity about their lives, but that I in fact begin to consciously or subconsciously seek to receive less information about them. 

## Drawbacks
- Humans begin expecting from one another that they're up-to-date on each other's feeds
- Someone commenting on / making jokes about another person's late response to a post
- Perceiving only the highlight reel parts of friends' lives
