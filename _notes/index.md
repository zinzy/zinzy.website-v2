I'm Zinzy, a person living and working in Amsterdam. This here is a quiet street of the Internet where I come to link and think. I share soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear.

I'm a researcher and designer making tools for people at work, a facilitator making resonant queer spaces, and a humble linguist who enjoys the art of writing.

This website is a vastly personal project.

Central to this website is a growing collection of undated notes that are perpetually subject to change. Currently, there are <span>{{ site.notes | size }}</span> notes. There is no index or archive or these notes. Instead, I invite you to start here: [[Now]], [[Consumption]], [[Bookmarks]] or [[About]].

If you're more into the traditional, dated nature of blogs, check out my [[journal]].
