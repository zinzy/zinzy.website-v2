When it comes to binging through an entire television series, I feel Anja and I are doing it right with this one. We began watching the 80s and 90s hit series _The Golden Girls_ in the Summer of 2022, and we're going at a rate of one episode at a time. 

It is glorious. 

My favorite things about the show so far:
- Betty White was surprisingly sexy
- The wordless shade that Dorothy throws just by making a certain phase is, to me, the best thing in comedy
- I attribute this to the show's age, but I love the fact that their comedy pauses last at minimum five times longer than any other sitcom I've seen
- It's great to be reminded that, without this show, there would've been no [[Sex and the City]]
