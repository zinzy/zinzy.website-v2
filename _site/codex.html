<ul>
  <li>My beliefs and principles may change and that’s okay</li>
  <li>Intuition knows the way</li>
  <li>I am ignorant and see only a very small fraction of reality from my own standpoint</li>
  <li>My questions are relevant</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="me">Me</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I am an optimist</li>
  <li>I make mistakes</li>
  <li>I am allowed to make mistakes, as long as I acknowledge that I make them</li>
  <li><a href="https://gregology.net/codex/" target="_blank">My emotions and feelings are my responsibility</a></li>
  <li>I’m great at finding connections with others</li>
  <li>I’m comfortable as long as I have an escape hatch</li>
  <li>I’m privileged because
    <ul>
      <li>I have no serious, untreatable physical disabilities</li>
      <li>I live in North-Western Europe</li>
      <li>I live in a country with solid infrastructure, excellent health care, and good education opportunities</li>
      <li>I feel safe and free presenting as queer with my partner</li>
      <li>I’m a light-skinned Afropean</li>
      <li>My partner and I are invested in our relationship</li>
      <li>I possess a skillset that grants me purchasing power</li>
      <li>I have close friendships with White people who are fiercely antiracist</li>
      <li>I draw connections easily</li>
      <li>I am good at teaching myself new skills</li>
      <li>I can express myself creatively</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I lack privilege because
    <ul>
      <li>I’m a person of color facing microagressions and living with the effects of macroagressions daily, and it has an effect on my overall health</li>
      <li>I’m a first-generation university graduate who grew up in an environment that didn’t prepare me for the complexities of university life</li>
      <li>I’m neurodivergent, and it sometimes the differences between me and others make me doubt whether I understand my own circumstances</li>
      <li>I live with the effects of a number of adverse childhood experiences</li>
      <li>I have been living with a persistent health challenge for most of my life, and although I’m recovering, it remains a daily focus</li>
      <li>I have very limited contact with my family members and relatives</li>
      <li>I am fat in a world that values thinness as social currency</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="people">People</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When engaging with a member of a particular group, assume they will have experienced the negative realities associated with that group until you learn otherwise</li>
  <li>You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar. This is one side of the coin; emotional labor is the other.</li>
  <li>Every person tries to do what they think will make the world a better place</li>
  <li>Sudden kindness can spark a great friendship</li>
  <li>White isn’t a color unless it’s a skin color</li>
  <li>Everybody’s lives are infinitely complex, vulnerable, precious, and potential, just like mine</li>
  <li>No person should be forced to carry on a relationship with a family member</li>
  <li>Sometimes, going no-contact with a parent is the least damaging option</li>
  <li>Some people should be child-free</li>
  <li>To ask others why they don’t have children is to enter dangerous territory</li>
  <li>Connection is the fuel of life</li>
  <li>The most productive way to learn about a group of people is by looking at the stories they tell themselves and others</li>
  <li>Pay for someone else or split the tab then and there. Don’t keep tabs of who owes what to whom</li>
  <li>Seeing yourself in other people is crucial to developing a healthy sense of self</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="spirit-and-philosophy">Spirit and philosophy</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I believe in God</li>
  <li>The ‘Judeo-Christian tradition’ is a harmful and unnecessary invention of Christianity</li>
  <li>Humans are a part of nature</li>
  <li>Religion is a gorgeously complex creation of humans to communicate about and with an existing something that they’ll never be able to fathom, harness, or identify</li>
  <li>The Bible is too complex to be taken literally</li>
  <li>While politically not always aligned with me, the Christian Left is my best source for Christian inspiration, and the only Google search term I can trust</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="money--how-to-get-it-what-to-do-with-it-and-how-to-feel-about-it">Money – How to get it, what to do with it, and how to feel about it.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You can spend money once</li>
  <li>It’s okay to work through shame about money</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="possessions--which-possessions-are-worth-having-why-and-how-do-you-use-them">Possessions – Which possessions are worth having, why and how do you use them?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A good pencil can go a long way</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="politics-and-policies">Politics and policies</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All politics is about identity, ergo “identity politics” is a pleonasm.</li>
  <li>People who consider it poor behavior to “bring identity into politics” prove with this very opinion that they are part of a group that is so well-represented in society that its characteristics aren’t considered “identity” but merely “reality”.</li>
  <li>It’s embarrassing that people want laws to govern what other people can do with their own bodies, especially if those laws are inspired by religious frameworks that are personal.</li>
  <li>Dutch law should prevent a prime minister from serving more than two terms</li>
  <li>Development aid, no matter how benevolent, is a flawed and belittling effort by definition</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="influences-and-recommendations">Influences and recommendations</h3>

<h3 id="work">Work</h3>
<ul>
  <li>One-on-one meetings should last no longer than 30 minutes</li>
  <li>Meetings with more than two people should last no longer than 1 hour</li>
  <li>If you want to explain something to one or two people, don’t prepare a slide deck</li>
  <li>When choosing to document, do so clearly, consistently, and like you’re speaking to a newbie and a veteran at the same time</li>
  <li>I collaborate best when I find a way to meet people where they are, no matter w</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="culture-and-society">Culture and society</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Low-culture artefacts (<a class="internal-link" href="/silly-archives">Silly archives</a>) are crucial tools for cultural analysis</li>
  <li>Reality is an elephant, each culture touches a part</li>
  <li>Seeing your experiences and reality reflected in media is crucial to developing a healthy sense of self</li>
  <li>History is told by the winner, and sometimes by the loudest</li>
  <li>People in their early- to mid-thirties should have access to Pokémon Red on a floppy disk, as well as a device on which to play it</li>
  <li>Being part of a minority doesn’t mean you’re more empathic to the lived experiences of people who are part of other minority groups. In my experience, white gay men can be worse with racism than white straight people.</li>
  <li>Queer rights are sometimes abused by straight people who want to convey anti-Muslim messages in friendly terms</li>
  <li>The words “breakfast” and “lunch”, when combined, shouldn’t result in a meal that <em>starts</em> after lunch</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="habits">Habits</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Yin yoga trains tolerance of discomfort</li>

  <li>Buy simple black t-shirts and wear one every day</li>
  <li>Ironing is a calming activity</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Discomfort is sometimes where growth happens</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My learning style should take me where it wants to go, more than a learning method should</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="chapter-7-making--work">Chapter 7: Making &amp; work</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It’s good to have one website as your central point of communication with the Internet</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use one notebook for everything</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pick a job with interesting problems</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="chapter-8-tips">Chapter 8: Tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
<em>Halloween</em> is the best horror movie franchise, in the very first place because of the blatant disregard the films have for one another.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="chapter-9-things-i-no-longer-believe">Chapter 9: Things I no longer believe</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><del>Any problem can be solved by a good book</del></p>
