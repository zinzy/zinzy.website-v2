<p>According to <span title="This note is not for public consumption (yet)" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Nielsen Norman Group  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span>, qualitative usability testing is the most effective method to improve usability.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> This and many other methods make up a range of qualitative user research tools designers use to answer their questions. But these tools can’t answer <em>all</em> of our questions.</p>

<h3 id="when-qualitative-user-research-cant-answer-the-question">When qualitative user research can’t answer the question</h3>
<p>When I’m planning a research effort I like to remind myself that <a class="internal-link" href="/users-can-t-tell-you-what-they-don-t-know">Users can’t tell you what they don’t know</a>. Qualitative user research can tell us about how and why, but less about the when and how many/much. Taken into account that people will rationalize their behavior, will only be able to tell you what they remember, and that they might give socially acceptable answers</p>

<ul>
  <li>In answering questions (particularly in a <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/focus-groups/" title="The Use and Misuse of Focus Groups" target="_blank">focus group</a>), people bend the truth to be closer to what they <strong>think you want to hear</strong> or what’s socially acceptable.</li>
  <li>In telling you what they do, people are really telling you what they <strong>remember</strong> doing. Human memory is very fallible, especially regarding the small details that are crucial for interface design. Users cannot remember some details at all, such as interface elements that they didn’t see.</li>
  <li>In reporting what they do remember, people <strong>rationalize</strong> their behavior. Countless times I have heard statements like “I would have seen the button if it had been bigger.” Maybe. All we know is that the user didn’t see the button.</li>
</ul>

<p>Taken from an interview with Michele Ronsen for UserInterviews.com. Michele identifies seven reasons why qualitative user research might not be the best option:</p>

<ol>
  <li>When you can answer your research question with analytics, secondary research, or by talking to your team. </li>
  <li>When you don’t know who your should be talking to. </li>
  <li>When you don’t know what you want to learn, or how you’ll use those learnings.</li>
  <li>When you don’t have enough time to do qualitative user research.</li>
  <li>When you’re going through the motions to prove your solution is right. </li>
  <li>When you don’t have stakeholder buy-in.</li>
  <li>When you haven’t right-sized the question.</li>
</ol>
