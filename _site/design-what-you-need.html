<p>As designers, one of the best skills we can develop is to choose our design deliverables carefully. Junior or medior designers, laser-focused on creating the best possible interface and interaction design at all cost, may have a habit of creating high-fidelity, clickable prototypes covering every part of a user flow. The reasoning here, I’ve found, may be that this type of deliverable best communicates the nuances and intricacies of a design.</p>

<p>Throughout <a href="/work" target="_blank">my design journey</a> I’ve come to see design as a collection of dialects: a set of different ways of speaking to a person or group of people in a way that best suits the purpose of the conversation. This way, the design I make to test a concept with users may differ greatly from what that same design would look like as a hand-off to developers.</p>

<h3 id="example-school-dashboard">Example: school dashboard</h3>
<p>To illustrate my thinking, I’ll use the example of a school principal logging onto her school dashboard every morning. The product team has decided to add an overview of the latest test results for this principal.</p>

<h4 id="ideate">Ideate</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Collaborate with stakeholders</li>
  <li>Codesign session with users</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="prototype">Prototype</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Various personas in user test (design for lowest threshold: high-fidelity prototypes)</li>
  <li>No click events beyond the basic click-through, because the test doesn’t aim to answer interactive questions, but rather comprehension questions</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="hand-off">Hand-off</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Existing elements all in place, very basic wireframe</li>
  <li>Hifi for the new component, because we’re adding a new library</li>
</ul>
