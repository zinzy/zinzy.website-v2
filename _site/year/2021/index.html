        <p>I never get much reading done unless I’m sleeping elsewhere. Most often, I associate sleeping elsewhere with having time off, and having time off means I’m away from a computer screen. This frees up time for reading.</p>

<p>Anja had booked a suite for my birthday at Okura, and six months after I turn 33, Covid measures are finally so mild that we actually get to do it. It’s on the sixteenth floor, overlooking the Amsterdam Centre and West Side. We eat like royalty, and fall asleep watching the sunset from our California King. I’m feeling like a million bucks.</p>

<p>Whenever we sleep elsewhere, I get overwhelmed with the endless possibilities of the things I can read. Usually, I manage to sneak five books into a suitcase, but for this weekend, I’ve limited myself to one: <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/42452986">Mary Magdalene Revealed</a></em>.</p>

<p>It’s a remarkable read, particularly given that the author Meggan Watterson got an MDiv and not an MFA in writing. Her words flow like a river, entirely sure of where she’s going. Every now and then, I’ll read a portion aloud to A, to share the joy of reading a theological work that is as inclusive and self-aware as it is unreserved and educational.</p>

<p>As I share snippets of insights, revelations in sweat lodges as well as things I never knew about the beauty of early Christianity, A asks me: “Don’t you find this book a bit… <em>The Da Vinci Code</em>-esque? I mean, all this talk of Mary Magdalene’s special relationship with Jesus, alternative plot lines… It’s like it’s all one big conspiracy theory, wouldn’t you say?”</p>

<p>A’s not the only woman who has made such remarks about this book. Isn’t it peculiar that feminists would rather deem femininity-inclusive gospels closer to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1400331">possibly the worst book in the English language that has emerged in the past decade</a> than to a perspective on Christ that could cure our heartaches?</p>

        <p>I am nostalgic about the way the Web used to be. I miss the handcrafted blogs that I used to visit, and the intimate windows they gave me into the lives of strangers.</p>

<p>I miss that I knew all the domain names by heart. It is a phantom pain of sorts; an unrest in the tip of my fingers reminding me I no longer need to make series of key combinations to find those personal public spaces, some more arts-and-craftsy than others, because most of them are gone. These days, I just circulate through a small number of news sites, like I did when I first got online as a young girl, not yet having found my way around the Internet.</p>

<p>By now it is such a cliché to even say it, but I don’t like the monolith that we’ve become. I detest your Instagram feed, which is a highlight reel even when it isn’t. Twitter is a garbage can. To me, it was never <em>just</em> about your content, it was about your form, too. About the typographic choices you made (Lucida Grande or Tahoma), the kind of camera you used, and the frequency of your updates.</p>

<p>I suppose the bottom line is that I just feel bored about the Web. I think I may have spent so much time navigating it through social media that I’ve lost my way around the blogosphere. Which these days, ironically enough, is the name of a company specialized in influencer marketing.</p>

        <p><em>This was written as part of <a href="https://www.vineandfig.co">Vine &amp; Fig</a>’s Sunday Scripture reflection project.</em></p>

<p>When Jesus sent out his Twelve, He told them: “Whatever place does not welcome you or listen to you, leave there and shake the dust off your feet in testimony against them.” If you’re not welcomed, not listened to, quietly withdraw. Don’t make a scene. Shrug your shoulders and be on your way.</p>

<p>Last week, a friend of ours in the Vine &amp; Fig community asked me to proofread a letter. It was addressed to her parents, and it asked, in the calm voice of a young woman embracing adulthood, whether or not she and her female partner could count on the same respect, dignity, and love that she saw flow from her parents to her siblings and their partners. Our friend and her partner had just moved in together, and things had gotten serious enough that an introduction was in order, even for her huge anti-queer Catholic family.</p>

<p>The letter asked, and it did not barter.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is not the first draft,” she tells me after I compliment her vulnerability and bravery, “the first one was me basically begging to be loved.” From where I’m sitting, I can see that this isn’t the first time our friend has had to beg. Her father and mother never seemed to have <em>gotten</em> this whole queer thing. They’ve been waiting for “this phase” to end for years. In their household, there is simply no “love for the gays”. It took a conversation with our friend’s future mother-in-law to make her look at her parents with her eyes open a little wider.</p>

<p>“You don’t need your parents as much as you think you do” the woman had said.</p>

<p>I imagine our friend crawling out from under the rubble left by the type of guilt only a Catholic parent can channel. I imagine the many lives in our community, with varying degrees of urgency, transforming as we come to understand the difference between a hurt that grows from love and one that grows from neglect.</p>

<p>I imagine all of us building a home, knocking on doors to see who will help us share love the way we see it, and learning to shake the dust off our boots and moving right along, even if it requires making a whole family from scratch.</p>

        <p>Her Summer break started yesterday, and as always it is an event. I am so excited about getting everything right that I mostly present as a frantic killjoy. <em>Jeopardy</em> makes everything better.</p>

<p>I start today with my usual bike route past the bakeries. Niemeijer for pain au choc and canelés, followed by tiger buns and krentenbollen at <a href="https://simonmeijssen.nl/">Simon Meijssen</a>. Niemeijer won best croissant of Amsterdam, but I think they’re too bready.</p>

<p>In the window of Meijssen they’re showcasing pride muffins. Neither of us likes muffins, but I buy two anyway. They’re surprisingly good.</p>

        <p>The other day, as I was speaking about a group of queer Black designers of which I’m a part, a White lesbian asked me: “when does a group exist just so a bunch of outcasts can commiserate about their shared otherness? I mean, could someone like <em>me</em> join?”</p>

<p>“Great questions,” I said, “my response is identical to what you would say if someone went ‘why do you need lesbian bars? You don’t see me going to a straight bar, do you?’”</p>

<p>“Fair enough” said the White lesbian.</p>

<p>I found an app called <a href="https://liberatemeditation.com/">Liberate</a>. It has beautiful meditations by Black and Indigenous teachers. I’ve always been a Headspace fan. Despite founder Andy’s cringey “I lived with the monks so you didn’t have to” marketing strategy, I appreciate the app for its interface and quality content. It hadn’t occured to me that the experiences I have as an Afropean could find their place in a meditation practice.</p>

<p>Part of me feels too indulgent for enjoying Liberate as much as I do. Listening to meditation teachers who have the understanding that microagressions are an actual reality in my actual life is just so different and amazing. Still, my subconscious feels sorry for the theoretical White people who would be uncomfortable if they found out I listen to Black meditations. <em>Why even bring your identity into it?!</em> Like a lesbian momentarily forgetting she’s allowed her lesbian bar.</p>

        <p>The weather is great, infection rates are down, and the Dutch government loosened Covid restrictions. Masks are no longer required in public indoor spaces. I’m at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/stfyFKAKsWndZSBA6">Basquiat</a> waiting to catch up with a friend, and an Irish woman strikes up a conversation.</p>

<p>“I like to sit here late in the afternoon to watch the sun set between the buildings. I can’t take much sun, I have Irish skin, you know.”</p>

<p>She sneezes, and I remark how, since March 2020, “gesundheit” has been replaced by dirty looks. “I need my allergy meds” she says, in her voice a hint of embarrassment. Then she tells me about her successes of late: she and the old English Bulldog next to her have finally begun frequenting the neighborhood bars again, the ones “where everyone recognizes them”. She’s also been making lots of new friends. She suspects it’s the sign she’s been sporting on her mobility scooter, which reads <em>if I die because of Covid, it’s not your fault.</em></p>

<p>“I feel so sorry for all the young people, you know? One of them told me they were scared to go out and party, fearing their reckless behavior would kill their grandparents. You know what I told him? I told him it wasn’t his fault. And you know what? He fell into my arms crying.”</p>

<p>Apparently, she hasn’t missed a single Sunday protest on Museum Square.</p>

<p>“It’s really insane, the weaponry and violence that are on standby on Sundays. I’m from Belfast, you know, so you could say I’ve been around the block a few times. Even in Belfast, during our protests, they only pulled out weapons when things got really tough. Here, it seems that’s their only strategy. And I’m from Belfast, go figure.”</p>

<p>In the evening, Anja and I go to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/xxuU3M4o5Ew9FRMG8" target="_blank">Dignita Hoftuin</a>, where our friends Evelyn and Sander plan to announce their elopement in Kopenhagen earlier this week. Upon arrival, before I’ve been able to discern whether I’d like to consent to anything, I receive a warm hug from my friend, and a handshake from a total stranger.</p>

<p>What makes the pandemic such a fickle game is that nobody looks like they’re infected. Everyone who breaches my personal space looks kind. Still, the Delta variant is coming for us, and I’m surprised by how much my conservatism sticks out like a sore thumb everywhere I go.</p>

        On May 2, 2018, as we got off the plane from Stockholm, I said calmly to Anja: "I think I may try not drinking for a week or so." Nothing dramatic had happened in Stockholm. We had just returned from a midweek staying with friends in the city, followed by a couple days at a cozy cabin in the woods. It was my first time meeting these friends and they are wonderful people: two kind-hearted, curious journalists and their young daughter. The father is an excellent home chef, and so we quickly bonded over soul food, shared political views, and wine.

        <p>I am on a 33-day streak picking my teeth before bed. I’ve designed a temptation bundle, pairing the activity with a few minutes of garbage television. During these days, I’ve made it through two seasons of <em>Love After Lockup</em> and six seasons of <em>Sister Wives</em>. It shouldn’t surprise you that my watching habit has extended well beyond the time it takes me to pick my teeth. Earlier this week I decided to tone it down and return the temptation bundle to its original intention. Not because I want to watch less garbage television, but because I don’t want <em>Sister Wives</em> to end.</p>

<p>I watched the trailer for <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WL3Jz8fDgFI">Them</a></em> and it didn’t take long for me to decide I wasn’t going to watch the series, despite how much I love Lena Waithe. People who are close to me know this already, but the classroom scene could have been taken from my life. I think I’m ready for <a href="https://audacity.substack.com/p/reality-is-horror-enough">Black narratives that don’t <em>just</em> center around the entertainment of collective and private trauma of Black people</a>.</p>

<p>We’re in the process of perfecting our tossed pasta recipe.</p>

        <p>One thing I appreciate is my growing ability to understand how small choices affect the quality of my day. I have a history of struggling with doing things that are good for me, and while I’ve always known that certain things have a more positive influence than others, I wasn’t always able to execute on them.</p>

<p>Lately, I’ve been tinkering with the way I organize my mornings. I’ve come to understand that, in order for me to have a good day, I need to incorporate, in this particular order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get up within 30 minutes of my first alarm going off</li>
  <li>Carry out a skin care routine I never thought I would be interested in</li>
  <li>Get out of the house within 30 minutes of me getting out of bed</li>
  <li>Walk for one hour</li>
  <li>Empty my Omnifocus inbox during this walk</li>
  <li>Arrive home and update YNAB</li>
  <li>Plan my day</li>
  <li>Empty my email inbox</li>
  <li>Make a smoothie</li>
  <li>Start my daily meetings</li>
</ul>

        <p>The world beyond the gender binary is vast and diverse. As a queer facilitator, I’ve come to appreciate the value of writing my pronouns behind my name when it shows up in a video call or on Slack. It makes it easier for people to be good allies to those of us who have come to use pronouns they weren’t assigned at birth.</p>

<p>As a non-binary person, one of the choices I have had to make was on the topic of pronouns. Surprisingly to some, I use “she”, but really I’ll listen to anything that’s not “it”. Multiple people have asked me why this is so. After all, isn’t the whole notion of being non-binary a departure from the “she” that I was assigned at birth?</p>

<p>Yes, but also…</p>

<p>I don’t mind “she”. To me, “she” is camp. A Bette Midler song, a Wendy meme. The affection with which Meryl and Goldie address each other in <em>Death Becomes Her</em>. A woman can be a “she”, and so can a non-binary or genderqueer person, a man, or a lamp.</p>

<p>Being called “she” doesn’t hurt my reality beyond the binary. On the contrary, it amuses me. Whenever I hear someone refer to me as “she”, I giggle a little, as if someone just ran a finger across my spine. It’s cabaret to me, because that person likely doesn’t use the same defition of “she” as me. This tickling of my sensibilities brings me much more delight than deciding what pronoun works best for me. None of them do.</p>

        <p>When I was a child, no physical activity brought me more delight than inline skating. I had a wonderful pair of skates; silver, neon pink, and teal, snuggly fitting my feet. I felt limitless on those wheels, cruising all around the neighborhood, learning tricks in the grocery store parking lot, and distance skating past farms and fields.</p>

<p>For the past five years, I’ve been telling myself that I should get a new pair of skates. There’s a skate store around the block from my house, and whenever I’d pass it, I’d find myself right back in the best part of my childhood. For five years, though, I never got around to actually buying them.</p>

<p>Until Covid.</p>

<p>Much like what seems everyone in Amsterdam and their grandmother, I’ve finally purchased a nice pair of skates. I got FR freeskates with three 110mm wheels as well as the protection gear I was always too cool to wear as a child. And when I say “everyone and their grandmother”, I mean enough people to keep me waiting for those skates for two weeks.</p>

<p>As a person who appreciates the (near-)instant gratification of next-day-delivery, waiting two weeks for a purchase to arrive seemed like an eternity.</p>

<p>Here’s what I did with that eternity:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Watched at least ten hours of freeskating flow videos</li>
  <li>Contemplated whether I should cancel my order and find less amazing skates that would arrive sooner</li>
  <li>Reminisce about how awesome skating felt when I was a child</li>
</ul>

<p>It was probably due to all this reminiscing that the concept of skating turned into an activity that you can’t unlearn, much like biking. My body remembered all the slides I could do, and the countless ways to stop. I figured I’d be able to take my skates out to the park within the first week or so.</p>

<p>Then they arrived.</p>

<p>Yesterday, twenty years afer I last skated, I unboxed and attempted to get into the skates. It took 30 minutes to figure out how to unlock the cuffs alone. Then it took ten minutes per skate to get the things on my feet. I’ve been awkwardly rolling around the living room ever since, grabbing onto chairs and door frames, unsure of which muscles I need to keep from falling and breaking off my front teeth.</p>

<p>I’m nowhere near old enough to complain about aging or being too old for shit, but at 33, I’m slowly embracing the concept of micro-aging. From time to time, I will meet something that confirms that my body, my mind, and my experiences have changed drastically from what they were when I was a child. From time to time, something will remind me that I’m no longer 17, and right now, skating is it.</p>

        <p>I’m terrible at keeping it a secret: my favorite time in the week is when A works from home. We spent the past month building a home office in a one-bedroom apartment, and I’m happy about the result. Monday is Uni day for her. I find it endearing that her Statistics course is throwing her for a loop a little bit.</p>

<p>“Work is so great!” I think to myself on Tuesday. My onboarding period is somewhat odd because of two separate parental leaves in my team. Now that my fellow designer is back again, I have to conclude that she is an utter blast. A attempts to use her iPad as a sidecar but doesn’t get the audio right. This makes it so that I can hear all of her pupils wrestle through <em>1984</em>. When she discusses a particular rainy scene, a girl says “like, I don’t know, it’s, like, just typically English”, and we both smile.</p>

<p>After work on Wednesday, I take a bike ride on A’s super fast ebike and almost run over a young woman in Vondelpark. Running after dusk without lights should be prohibited. I bike for miles and get lost a couple times, one of the perks of living in a large city like Amsterdam I call that. I plan to go to bed early, but find myself drifting in and out as we watch the second impeachment of Trump until past midnight instead.</p>

<p>On Thursday, my <a href="/now">Now</a> page is published on <a href="https://nownownow.com/p/Tptv">nownownow.com</a>. After a beautiful day at the home office, I’m excited to play around with the Apple Watch I got in the mail when my mother calls me at 9 p.m. On speaker phone, she pours a wide variety of complaints into the room, and I tell her I don’t need her parentification<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. It’s no use expecting that she will remember what I say three months from now, so I tell her the truth.</p>

<p>I accidentally have myself a total Miracle Morning on Friday: I meditate on kindness, I take a walk in the neighborhood, and update my finances. We hate-watch the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13649692/"><em>Surviving Death</em></a> episodes on mediums. A tells me she’s been to more than one seance in her life. I wish there was a separate TV channel just for medium weekend retreats.</p>

<p>On Saturday, at 990 days of sobriety, I sign up for a queer-friendly AA meeting. Not drinking is easy, but I haven’t begun to connect my alcohol abuse to the rest of my life, and it makes me feel weird. I spend the better part of the day tinkering with my personal site.</p>

        <p>As soon as she hands you the gift<br />
you know it’s another one<br />
“Trans Life Survivors”<br />
says the cover<br />
“Merry Christmas!”<br />
says your sister<br />
you have only been using<br />
they/them pronouns<br />
in private<br />
for a year or so<br />
it’ll look so beautiful next to<br />
the ex-gay book<br />
your other sister presented to you<br />
on your birthday last month</p>

<p>At family dinner you<br />
spend bathroom breaks in your<br />
childhood bedroom<br />
five in total<br />
logging on to talk to us<br />
about how the heavy things feel<br />
being the punching bag<br />
on which your 11-year-old cousin<br />
practises her right hook<br />
screaming fire about<br />
her trans classmate<br />
stings<br />
and<br />
it stings<br />
like a shattered jaw</p>

<p>Your father-in-law planned a<br />
Christmas pub crawl of sorts<br />
Covid-style<br />
each of the siblings hosting<br />
the entire family<br />
for a portion of the day<br />
hopping from house to house<br />
eating, drinking, loving the way only<br />
a big family will<br />
At the fourth stop you are full<br />
zonking off into the distance<br />
catching the smiling face of your<br />
sister-in-law on the way there<br />
and you remember what<br />
it felt like when<br />
she wouldn’t come to
your lesbian wedding</p>

<p>For you and them<br />
there is no Family<br />
not since you came out as non-binary<br />
and your parents<br />
yelled<br />
“check please”<br />
the only trace of<br />
those you came from<br />
is the card your grandmother sent<br />
She writes “I wanted you to<br />
know I support you”<br />
She is a sweetheart<br />
it is a teardrop in the desert<br />
that you cling to</p>

<p>Your father was no exception<br />
first the pandemic<br />
now the respirator<br />
the store has been extra busy these days<br />
but you’re getting by<br />
it’s keeping your mind off<br />
of how much he was hoping<br />
you’ll find a girl someday soon<br />
Today, the phone call<br />
from the hospital<br />
lets you know that<br />
he can come home for Christmas<br />
The disappointment you feel<br />
sits in your body like a monster</p>

<p>You have all the time in the world<br />
to tell me how you’re doing<br />
but not a moment to yourself<br />
to commit to the act<br />
with all those relatives in the house<br />
prone to restricting themselves to<br />
those parts of the Bible<br />
that make Christianity look easy<br />
and you being back<br />
in the home of your youth<br />
after the attempt<br />
confirms what you fear and<br />
what your parents have been saying<br />
is true about your life<br />
“I have no love for the gays in my heart”<br />
your father said<br />
You wonder how gay<br />
he knows you are<br />
I wonder where you’ve hidden<br />
the Pride flag that I sent you<br />
as a housewarming gift</p>

<p>Colossians 3:26 The freedom of HaShem is the wisdom to decide who is truly your sister, your brother, your father, your mother. Don’t let the bastards grind you down.</p>
