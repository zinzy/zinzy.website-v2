        Happiness today is the ease with which the nun gives me his phone number. Paul is an old friend, or really an old friend of my ex, and we haven't spoken in eight years.

        It snowed a few times this week and I was as baffled as I always am to see it happening in March. I don’t have a great understanding of what the weather’s supposed to do in a given period of the year.

        <p>Lemonade, Lemonade, Lemonade. Who knew I would ever become a dog person? Two weeks ago, we picked up our corgi Lemonade Zelda Loulé. There was a torrent of research both Anja and I did to prepare for this puppy. There was a birth announcement card. A <a href="https://www.anneliewambeek.com/">godmother</a> was appointed. Here are some things I learned after two weeks with a dog.</p>

        <p>She blesses Anja, me, and a handful of other people who carved out time in their Sunday evenings to come to Church. I have never been inside this particular church building before, and chuckle at how <em>new</em> the Old Catholic decor is: in imagery and candle lighting possibilities it’s reminiscent of the average Dutch Roman Catholic church. Its white walls and central heating tell me something different.</p>

<p>Living in a good neighborhood has many advantages. One of them is that it makes me want to spend a lot of time there. Saturday morning is very likely my favorite day in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>I get up, without an alarm, around 6:30, engage in some morning writing, and fanny around the house for a bit. I take a shower at 7:45, and walk to my favorite coffee place at 08:20. Sometimes I wait outside for a few minutes until their doors open at 08:30.</p>

<p>“Medium decaf mocaccino, half cow’s milk, half Tony Chocolonely.” I say it, but none of the baristas need reminding. Sometimes I bring my computer to work on my personal site, sometimes I bring a book and my diary. I’m not the only one who lives Saturday mornings like this.</p>

<p>This morning I hung out, drawing people who were conducting a similar Saturday morning routine. A great start to the weekend.</p>

<p>Walking with Annelie is coffee indoors today. We’ve told each other we need to go on more walks. She asks if we should dress warmly for the cold, wet park, or if we should just grab a table inside. Normally at this hour, Coffee Company is packed to the brim with digital nomads, so “dress for cold, hope for warmth” I say. Miraculously, there are two tables from which we can choose.</p>

<p>I’m so proud of the work Annelie has been doing, <a href="https://www.anneliewambeek.com/" target="_blank">building a business from scratch</a>, and wrapping her head around how she can do her best work. We discuss productivity; tools, methods, apps, Etsy calendar print-outs. Today, I tell her how much <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@elizabethfilips" target="_blank">Elizabeth Filips</a> has been helping me. We decide we should join <a href="https://www.meetup.com/shutupandwriteamsterdam/" target="_blank">Shut Up &amp; Write</a> sometime.</p>

<p>It was clear from the start to both Anja and I that Annelie would make a great godmother for <a href="http://lemonade.waleson.us/" target="_blank">Lemonade the puppy</a>. We’ve decided to go full over-the-top with anything dog-related, and luckily Annelie is more than happy to review my birth announcement card options. She couldn’t radiate more enthusiasm about this dog if she tried. And she hasn’t even met her yet.</p>

<p>As we shmoozed over coffee, I was reminded of the time when doing this indoors wasn’t even possible. I remember the Coffee Company line going all the way around the block, the overflowing trash bins with paper coffee cups, the increasing amount of fresh air we were all taking in. It’s nice to spend time indoors again, but I do miss the park. I can’t wait for spring to start.</p>

<p>January flew, <em>flew</em> by, I tell you. We started with “wow, 2023 already, let’s have a chill time this year, hey what’s on Netflix?” and at the time of writing everything is different:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Things are not chill, because we’re preparing ourselves, our lives, and our house for our first-ever puppy</li>
  <li>Both our work lives are unexpectedly bustling and busy</li>
  <li>We cancelled Netflix</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve been saying for years that I’d be willing to pay 100 euros a month for a single, all-encompassing international streaming platform. I suppose it’s never going to happen, but, hey, at least we’ll have that puppy, right?</p>

<h3 id="the-puppy">The puppy!</h3>
<p>Like I said, we kicked off the year very quietly, thinking “meh, someone asked us if we wanted a puppy, but we’re not really sure just yet.” This all changed ones we learned that eight healthy puppies were born and we were allowed to pick first. <a href="/2023/01/15/sneak-preview/" target="_blank">We went for a visit</a> mid-January, and fell deeply in love with little Lemonade, who’s coming home at the end of February.</p>

<p>I went from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogfree/" target="_blank">serious dog-free advocate</a> to an expecting dog parent in two months’ time, and I suppose it’s safe to say I’ve gone a bit mad. I’m designing a birth announcement card, and <a href="https://lemonade.waleson.us/" target="_blank">the puppy may or may not already have a website</a>. Help me.</p>

<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>I picked up a few great titles at the <a href="https://www.oba.nl/openingstijden/detail.199270.html/oba-oosterdok/" target="_blank">library</a> this month. One that was helpful to get through was, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/15733923" target="_blank"><em>Loose Cannons Back on Track</em></a>, about managing gifted neurodivergence in the workplace. At the moment, I’m thoroughly enjoying <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/321863.One_Continuous_Mistake" target="_blank"><em>One Continuous Mistake: Four Noble Truths for Writers</em></a> by Gail Sher.</p>

<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
<p>Musically, the year is off to a great start. I’ve made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-INeMspNSQ0" target="_blank">a new Brian Eno discovery</a> that’s hard not to love, found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMJm_97QXHA" target="_blank">Mitski gem</a> that has been on repeat, and added a great track to my work playlist: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2qsU8FGU_E" target="_blank">Tieduprightnow by Parcels</a>. As always, I’ve compiled a playlist of all of these and more. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6Xlr2LlyTQuCdgWd46KNUI?si=980c41a80e134089" target="_blank">Feel free to check it out</a>.</p>

<h3 id="watching">Watching</h3>
<p>I saw <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7322224/" target="_blank"><em>Triangle of Sadness</em></a> again this month, and loved it more than I did the first time. I appreciate how well this movie understands the finality of our social roles, and how, at the same time, they can be transformed in the blink of an eye. In addition, I am secretly a 13-year-old boy who likes to look at people drowning in their own vomit and excrement.</p>

<p>Anja and I also began watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15677150/" target="_blank"><em>Shrinking</em></a>, which is surprisingly fun. ‘Men’s liberation movement’ like <em>Ted Lasso</em>, but ever so slightly more depressing and realistic.</p>

<h3 id="something-else">Something else</h3>
<p>I find myself looking for great influencers focused on gifted neurodivergence. Like those many awesome YouTubers sharing tips and tricks on how to live with ADHD, but for giftedness, and not in some Mensa kind of way, but just something that’s honest about the challenges one may encounter. Most of what I find is written by pedagogues for parents of gifted children. If you know of anything, feel free to <a href="/hello" target="_blank">let me know</a>.</p>

<p>There’s a woman who runs a <a href="https://www.athenaeum.nl/winkels/zuidoost" target="_blank">bookshop in De Bijlmer</a>. She has kind eyes that make you want to curl up with a book and a cup of tea. Often when I’m there, she offers just that: tea, and a place to quiet down and dive into an interesting title. She’s running a fine business over there, Cole Verhoeven is.</p>

<p>Aside from bookshop owner she’s also a writer. I love the work she does at <a href="https://www.oneworld.nl/" target="_blank">One World</a>, where she articulates <a href="https://www.oneworld.nl/lezen/opinie/witte-fragiliteit-bestaat-niet/" target="_blank">strong perspectives</a> <a href="https://www.oneworld.nl/lezen/discriminatie/sociaal-onrecht/woke-ooit-een-waarschuwing-voor-racisme-nu-een-conservatief-hondenfluitje/" target="_blank">on antiracism</a> <a href="https://www.oneworld.nl/lezen/opinie/kamala-harris-is-niet-de-eerste-geschikte-zwarte-vrouw/" target="_blank">and equity</a>. A few weeks ago, she sold me this book:</p>

    </div>
</div>

<p>When I took it from the shelf, I didn’t know she was the one who wrote it. Eventually, she told me she had drawn inspiration from the questions her child asks her. The questions often leave her bemused, surprised, stunned. I suppose they’re the questions we forget to ask as we grow older.</p>

<p>It’s a perfect coffee table book, deserving of a central place in the house to welcome guests into an atmosphere of curiosity and whimsy.</p>

<p>One page that stands out to me is this one. There must have been countless times I wondered similar things as a child. Why are the garbage men brown? Why do all the other colored people live on the other side of the tracks? Why don’t I see myself on television?</p>

<p>I imagine the life of Cole’s child, growing up in this part of history, with a Black parent at home to raise him, in one of the most diverse cities in Europe. Access to a Black-owned bookshop that helps people see themselves in others. It makes me feel equal parts envy and calm.</p>

<p>My attempt to lure both Anja and myself outside for some fresh air and a walk was thwarted as soon as I learned the place was out of my favorite bubble tea. We strolled to Flevopark, in my hand an ice cream cone, and on my face the disappointment of a toddler who can’t be satisfied.</p>

<p>The park has a wide field that allows loose dogs to roam freely in the off-season. Even through the trees Anja and I spotted the corgi from half a mile away.</p>

<p>“I mean, we could just go up and chat a little, right? She might have some good tips?” Anja and I wondered, looking for an excuse to get closer to the dog. We must have looked completely adorable, because the face of Kenny’s owner brightened once she noticed us lingering nearby.</p>

<p>She told us about their routine, how he could already stay home alone for most of the day, and how she’d had never heard him bark. Within minutes we learned we all know Lalo, another corgi in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>It’s nice getting to know this new corner of the neighborhood. She and I are dog people now.</p>

<p>We had two friends over today. They’re dear to me specifically because we got to know each other intimately during our eating disorder recovery. We promised we’d one day get together and watch <em>Love Actually</em>, much-beloved by each of us.</p>

<p>I’ve developed a habit of watching this film at least once a year. Despite its soft romcomness, homogenous cast, and general lack of depth it has taught me volumes on relationships. I love it more with each viewing.</p>

<p>Today, for the first time, perhaps, I saw its fat-phobia for what it really is. It left a sour taste in my mouth; one that reminds me I’m not the audience of the film, or at least not part of the audience who should feel good after the credits begin to roll.</p>

<p>It’s annoying to see how a home cinema afternoon can make my body experience drop so significantly. I suppose if there’s any month in the year to be confronted with this, it would be International Diet Culture Month, ay?</p>

<p>On occasion, Anja will compliment me on my ability to recognize people. I don’t know when I first noticed it myself, but there are actors I recognize even if they played minor characters in an episode of a show I watched 15 years ago. Or I might point out that woman I saw on the bus before COVID hit to a confused Anja.</p>

<p>I’m learning it’s not a very common trait because of the scoffing sound I make whenever Anja confuses Keira Knightly and Daisy Ridley, or Michelle Pfeiffer and Meg Ryan. I only recently became aware how much of a jerk that makes me, and how, if we were in a room full of people, I’d stick out like a sore thumb.</p>

<p>I’ve wondered if I could be classified as a super-recognizer. I remember taking the test a few years ago and stopping halfway through, fearing that I’d see the faces of the people in my dreams and nightmares for all of eternity.</p>

        <html><body>
<p>This morning I got acquainted with the immigrant anxiety felt by Chinese-American journalist Jiayang Fan about her desire to speak accentless English. In <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/786/its-a-game-show" target="_blank">an episode of one of my favorite podcasts, <em>This American Life</em></a>, Jiayang participated in a game show designed around a talent she claims to possess: the unique ability, inspired by her anxiety, to tell at what age a Chinese-American person came to the United States. The show gave her recordings of three people to prove herself. (She got 0 out of 3.)</p>

<p>Nothing human is alien to me, and neither is Jiayang’s desire to blend in phonetically.</p>

<p>Growing up in the Dutch South, I wasn’t ever unaware of my accent, but it took me enrolling in Utrecht University to become fully aware of the effect it had on others. I could barely make it through class participation without someone chuckling in the back row of lecture hall. I decided that, on the very day I found housing in Utrecht, I would change my accent. These days, few people can tell I’m from the South. I like it that way.</p>

<p>Another thing I’ve always been afraid to sound was “black”. In the Netherlands, that usually means sounding like you were born and (partially) raised in an African country, Suriname, or the Antilles. With no such history, I’m silly to think I could ever fall into that category, which is a fine category in itself. Still, every now and then people will tell me I sound Surinamese. Unable to shake my internalized racism, I always find myself offended when they do.</p>

<p>Today’s episode reminded me of the duality of being a person of color in a conversation about speech. Like Jiayang, I find myself comparing my speech to that of other Black people, forming opinions on what I think is or isn’t “good”. At the same time, I would find it problematic if other, non-Black people were doing it for me. To me, there’s nothing inherently wrong in that distinction; it’s important people can tell their own story and not have it told for them. I’m just struck by the number of times I asked “babe, is this the example we want to give?”</p>

<p>Sometimes, when bad news arrives, I think to myself “argh, just when I was beginning to think life was nice and steady!” Today is one of those days. I’m immediately thrown off, though mostly by the scenarios playing out in my head. Not because of the particular fact of which I learn.</p>

<p>I’m disappointed by the rediscovery of life’s unsteadiness. At the same time, there’s beauty to be found. After all, there have been times in my life when I’ve been so anxious that bad news wasn’t an interruption, but a confirmation of what I already thought I knew.</p>

<p>Today, a cloud blocks the sun. I remind myself that it’s a whole lot better than rain all year round.</p>

<p>In a few days, I’ll hit my one-month mark on the piano. When I bought it and began playing, I made sure to keep an open mind about how I learn best; not following any particular method, but tailoring practices to my interests, speed, challenges, and desires.</p>

<p>One learning strategy that always works best for me is a top-down approach. With the piano, there’s great benefit in playing music from sheets (of which I’m capable), but I could tell something had been missing. This morning, as I woke early once again, this time at 03:20 a.m., I realized the missing part was an overview of which chords work in a particular key.</p>

<p>This morning over coffee at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ccjavaplein" target="_blank">my favorite spot</a>, I did some digging and found <a href="https://piano-music-theory.com/" target="_blank">Piano-Music-Theory.com</a>, which has a wonderful series on diatonic chords. If you’re not familiar, these are chords belonging to notes that make up a particular scale. Knowing the diatonic chords of each scale is going to benefit my flexibility on the piano, because I’ll be able to play songs in whichever key I need.</p>

<p>As I was drawing up a matrix of what I was learning, I remembered how special music theory really is. I love its intricacy and depth, and how it manages to capture one of life’s most extraordinary things: combinations of sounds that can tell a story.</p>

<p>More than any other time in my online life am I aware of the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text. I make a point to write image descriptions whenever I can. Kind strangers with a variety of accessibility needs have been helping me understand how to best capture my interpretation of an image. I’ve come to regard <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text as the secret side bar I get to have with blind people and others who need it.</p>

<p>For me, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text raises interesting cultural questions, particularly around its growing visibility. Traditionally, it requires that people who don’t use accessibility tools hover an image to produce what I call “the world’s slowest tooltip”. In addition, I’ve been seeing a growing number of people work <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text into places where it doesn’t exist. Places that don’t require a hover. Two examples of this are <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@zinzy" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>’s profile and banner images.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I saw the profile picture of a young woman winking. Her bio captured the image with something along the lines of “young woman looking seductively at the camera, winking, and slightly sticking out her tongue hoping to engage the viewer”. Before reading that text I felt engaged indeed, my mind painting a quick image of what her manic pixie dream girl university campus life would be like.</p>

<p>Reading her description of the image had an effect. I gather it was the overtness — her self-awareness about what the image could convey — that somehow put me off just slightly. The image and not so much her description of it but the very fact that I could even see that description, and that she understood I would, changed how I saw her in the image. It also changed how I see the Internet.</p>

<p>What does it mean, I’ve been thinking ever since, that people with no need for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text get to peek behind its curtain? What effect can this form of double meaning-making have? Does it mean we’ll eventually go on to describe images differently, knowing that not a portion of our audience but the entirety of it is looking on? Does it mean we may, some day, try to say less with imagery? In one way, I’d consider that reduction of fluff a triumph for accessibility.</p>

<p>Today, Piper Haywood’s blog <a href="https://piperhaywood.com/wais-alt-decision-tree/" target="_blank">put me onto a handy <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text decision tree</a>. I’m entirely surprised to read that the answer to the final question in the tree, “Is the image purely decorative or not intended for the user?”, is “use an empty <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code>” and not “don’t post the image”.</p>

<p>I guess that paints the best picture of how much of a reductionist I am.</p>

<p>Have you heard? Anja and I are getting a dog. It was up in the air for a little while, but we got the confirmation yesterday that we’ll get first pick of a nest of eight adorable little Pembroke - Cardigan corgi mixes. We’re meeting the puppies for the first time on Sunday. Are you crying? I’m crying.</p>

<p><a href="/2022/12/30/2022-in-review/" target="_blank">2022 showed me</a> that there are serious drawbacks to being an A type personality. The way it helps Anja and I prepare for a puppy isn’t one of them. Too excited to sleep, I now <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@zinzy/109674435586703598" target="_blank">wake at 04:15</a> to formulate schedules, training OKRs, and crate strategies.</p>

<p>Annoyingly, I’ve now become one of those people who thinks they know a minuscule sliver of the dread expecting parents must feel, aiming to read all of the world’s parenting books before retiring on the idea that, at the end of the day, it’s all about intuition and consistency.</p>

<p>In one of the many jubilant reviews garnered by Darren Aronofsky’s latest film <em>The Whale</em>, one writer concluded that we shouldn’t judge a book by its cover. This was in reference to the morbidly obese main character who eventually dies, but not before we find out he developed an eating disorder out of grief. Here was a fat man who evidently had feelings despite his exterior. Ironically, I find myself doing just what the writer suggested I don’t: judge the film before I’ve seen it.</p>

<p>As a fat person, I’m surprised to have forgotten some of the tropes society has formulated about bodies like mine. It might be the time I’ve spent recovering from an eating disorder, my underuse of popular (and harmful) social media, or my Blur It Out browser extension, but I apparently had been living in a kinder world. Everything about <em>The Whale</em> puts a damper on that experience.</p>

<p>Many may marvel at Brendan Fraser’s stellar performance, I see a minstrelsy of fatness. While undoubtedly not its primary purpose, <em>The Whale</em> reminds fat people that life is absolutely different for people who are not like us. Non-fat people can use the film to reconcile with fatness, to see the humanity behind the physical. Fat people can get reacquainted with how they’re supposed to see themselves, employing <em>The Whale</em> for scale.</p>

<p>I have a feeling 2023 will be the year for weird movies that steal our hearts. Look at <em>Triangle of Sadness</em> and <em>White Noise</em>. Here you have two high-budget oddball films that I’d describe not as mumblecore but coastercore, pulling you from one weird subnarrative into another, not really making up their minds about what they are, and before you’ve formed a full opinion on it, the ride is over, but you loved it.</p>

<p>It reminds me of the dawn of black brutalist typefaces mixed with pastel and neon gradients in web design: you look at it and your body says “wtf” and your heart goes “yes”.</p>

<p>I’ll await further data to see if I have any type of a point.</p>
