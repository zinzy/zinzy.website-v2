        <p>My better judgement to the contrary, admitting to people in the real world that I maintain a personal website always feels like I’m admitting to being a furry on the weekends. Not to kink-shame anyone here. Perhaps it’s the provincial, pedestrian childhood I had, but <em>Jambers</em>, the Flemish show in which Paul Jambers interviewed cabinet of curiosities, has been edged deeply into my memory and I suspect that of many other millennials.</p>

        <p>In one way or another, the number 36 has felt like a milestone birthday for a long time. As a tween, I imagined the glamourous autonomy that came with being 36 because I was hooked on watching the televised adventures of a foursome of privileged White women in Manhattan. Now, finally at 36, it feels important that I could’ve had a child as an adult who would now also be an adult. I say “adult” but we all remember the self-important idiots we were at 18.</p>

        <h3 id="covid">Covid</h3>
<p>It’s curious to see my response to a bout of Covid is not much different from what it was in early 2020. Despite a <a href="/2023/11/19/week-46">negative test</a>, symptoms tell me everything I need to know. I have to remind myself every day this week that, given the regulations, I’m not obliged to quarantine. Nevertheless, Anja and I are both barely able to walk the dog. I work half days, and spend my afternoons in bed with hot water bottles.</p>

<p>Later in the week, I have cabin fever that is so intense it makes me cry in the park a little bit. On Sunday, the only thing I’m left with is a stuffy nose as well as some fatigue. God, I hope I don’t develop long Covid.</p>

<h3 id="consuming">Consuming</h3>
<p>Anja and I watch season two of <em>Somebody Somewhere</em>. It makes me regain a new appreciation for Bridget Everett’s physical comedy, new sincerity, and sass. I wish she and I were friends.</p>

<h3 id="tinkering">Tinkering</h3>
<p>I make some changes to my website this week, centering a page of text with links on the homepage. Sometimes, I feel bad that I don’t take screenshots every time I change it. But I suppose my continuous redesign strategy prevents that from being realistic.</p>

<h3 id="politics">Politics</h3>
<p>On Wednesday, the country has her very own 2016 American election result: after 20 years of being (rightfully) ridiculed as a far right party, PVV is finally the biggest, taking 37 of 150 seats in the House. Most people in my safe, progressive, friendly Amsterdam that I’ve spoken with are gobsmacked. Party leader Geert Wilders has become Geert Milders. A part of me is angry and sad, but a much larger part says: welcome to my world.</p>

        <ul>
  <li>I’m making an attempt this week to make my weeknotes more of a personal record rather than a performance of how exciting my week is. What I’ve written answers the question I might ask myself seven years from now: what was life like this week?</li>
  <li>I went on the road for on-site research on Tuesday, and was delighted by the particular nursing home that we visited. It seems many Dutch healthcare organizations have understood that environments that resemble the real-life environments of patients contribute to their overall wellbeing. The various spaces we saw were tailored to what life must have been like when the elderly clients were younger: a fifties barber shop, a diner-like restaurant. It was endearing. More professionally, I continue to be stunned by the working lives of people in healthcare. Having to balance tight budgets and strict schedules on the one hand and genuinely wanting the best for clients on the other is not an easy feat.</li>
  <li>It seems like I did pick up Covid while there.</li>
  <li>I’ve begun watching <em>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters</em> and I love my life. The farther I become removed from the humanities major version of myself, the easier it becomes to admit I love monster disaster stories.</li>
  <li>I’ve also begun watching the second season of <em>The Morning Show</em>, and two episodes in I understand why Anja urged me to really, <em>really</em> give it a try. Reese Witherspoon making out with Julianna Margulies is not the stuff of dreams I thought I needed, but here we are. Acting, storyline etc. also good.</li>
  <li>The Israel-Hamas War continues to rage, which has begun to feel like a weird name for the conflict. I wonder what it means that, when I Google those words, the Wikipedia entry to which I’m directed is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hamas_attack_on_Israel">
2023 Hamas attack on Israel</a>.</li>
  <li>I will never have first-hand experience of what it means to be a Jewish person in the world today, although I’ve been having a second-hand experience that has been leaving me… perturbed. When people discover my partner is Jewish, the tone of the conversation shifts. Not in a pro-Palestinian way, but in the way Jenna Maroney felt the urge to touch Liz Lemon’s hand after learning that Liz had met Oprah on a flight (which, of course, turned out to be a random Black woman).</li>
  <li>While I tested negative, I did spend Friday evening and night in bed with a fever and a body that felt as though it had been hit by a truck. Anja did test positive on Sunday, and so now we’re quarantining. March 2020 all over again.</li>
  <li>I keep thinking a lot about Osama Bin Laden. About the lack of context given by the journalist who shared parts of his <em>Letter to the American people</em> on social media. How TikTok and X, at least for a moment, were rife with people who were barely born when 9/11 happened, proclaiming support for Bin Laden because he had pro-Palestinian things to say. About the importance of digital literacy in the classroom.</li>
  <li>Whenever I’m ill, I bake or cook. I feel bad not doing anything and lying in bed all day, and following a recipe always seems like a good way to pass the time. This week, I made apple crumble custard <em>vlaai</em>. You can take the girl out of Limburg (and thank God for that), but…</li>

        <p>Yesterday at the Climate March, someone shouted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_river_to_the_sea#Criticism">“From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free”</a>. It was an unfortunate thing. A clean example of the climate changing instantaneously among 85,000 activists.</p>

<p>I was there for four reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>My definition of God is “science is indescribably beautiful and we must respect her”</li>
  <li>I can’t think of a more regrettable waste of tax money than having to spend it on health issues we can prevent if only we take better care of our environment</li>
  <li>I have a weak spot for an activist friend, who, through stealth influencing, had instilled in me a deep sense of FOMO about the event</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_in_the_Netherlands">Dutch carnival season</a> had kicked off on November 11, and I was in the mood for a parade</li>
</ol>

<p>The phrase was understandable coming from the Palestinian woman. Still, I appreciate that its most vicious context of use taints it so ferociously with antisemitism that deploying it as a vehicle for unity is a recipe for disaster. The crowd was so immense that it took hours of dancing in place before we even got started on the route. By the time we got to Museum Square, the words had already left the woman’s mouth.</p>

<p>We got there just in time to watch Greta Thunberg, who had been marching with us, turning her face away from cameras to remind us of why she was there. In between her on the stage and us on the field there were three screens, each projecting her face from a distance. I <em>believe</em> she was there, but the crowd was too big to say anything with much certainty.</p>

<p>My activist friend is one of those rare white people: privileged enough to belong to the 1% of a <em>variety</em> of subgroups, yet so antiracist it brings a tear to your eye. A seeker of nuance and complexity. A political unicorn. As we stood in the longest line I had ever seen, sharing the weight of a “THE CRISIS IS NOW” banner, I said to her: “it’s so… White here.” “Yes,” she said, mildly embarrassed it seemed, “it’s actually a huge problem for us that we could use some help with.”</p>

<p>Growing up in the Dutch South, there was a peculiar detail to the way I engaged with other people of color. I didn’t. There was no nod in the street, no tribe to which I belonged, no “our stories of minority and loneliness resonate”. Color blindness was the tune, and we were dancing to it. After almost a decade in Amsterdam I’ve come to consider this lack of acknowledgement poor behavior. There’s not a black person in the neighborhood I don’t know. I had forgotten my life wasn’t always like this, until yesterday. I counted no more than ten people of color in the crowd, and I exchanged looks with not a single one of them.</p>

<p>Whenever I find myself in a sea of vast whiteness, I ask myself: “where am I, why are there no other people of color here, and should I <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5052448/"><em>Get Out</em></a>?” Don’t get me wrong, I love white people. <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeOfMyBestFriendsAreX">Some of my best friends are white people.</a> My <em>wife</em> is a white person. Consider it a habit I’ve developed growing up in the Netherlands, where nothing about ethnicity is quite as it seems.</p>

<p>What solidifies Greta Thunberg’s identity as a Zoomer is the radical solidarity she and her contemporaries practice, seemingly without effort. Once she finally got on stage, her first act of compassion was to return the word to the Palestinian woman whose sound had been disconnected immediately after she had said the phrase.</p>

<p>What followed is what you may expect to happen when a person traumatized by an active war has to find it in herself to pick up where she left off to tell 85,000 mostly white faces how climate justice and justice for Palestine can exist on the same stage.</p>

<p>It was <em>mayhem</em>.</p>

<p>Once Greta had the mic again, she decided to keep her speech brief, much to the dismay I’m sure of all the people who felt blessed to share a moment in Amsterdam with her. Not <em>so</em> brief, however, that a man couldn’t walk on stage and declare he was there for the climate and not for politics.</p>

<p>The respectability politics are vile today. All I can think about is the power of the speech that could have been. The one in which a Palestinian woman addresses a vast sea of white faces who all listen intently to her talk about climate change. The way she says the words “river” and “sea” only when referring to natural bodies of water. The way she captivates her audience until the very end, when she pulls a Hannah Gadsby to remind us all of the hypocrisy and dangers of compartmental solidarity. The way she nods quietly to the upcoming elections.</p>

<p>The respectability politics are vile today. March-induced feelings of disappointment, uninspired virtue signalling, and racism find each other. A discombobulated display of on-stage pain and the very notion of pro-Palestinian sentiment have quickly been conflated into a rhetoric with which I feel increasingly uncomfortable: that people in power decide when minorities speak about their place in the world. That, when we talk about climate justice, every other topic must give way. That, when we march for a cause that seems to predominantly attract white people, unwritten rules of radical inclusion don’t apply. I feel the climate activism community interviewed for a job with me, and as a result I want to burn its résumé.</p>

<p>It makes me sad.</p>

<p>I’m sad because there are people who think climate justice can exist outside of politics. I’m sad because so many people don’t understand that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_personal_is_political">the personal is political</a>. I’m sad because I want to engage in climate activism, but I don’t feel there’s a place for me at the table. I’m sad because, right now, climate activism feels like a Gutmensch hobby. I’m sad for all the people who can’t tell the difference between antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment. I’m sad for our Uncle Eli from Tel Aviv who is in and out of his bomb shelter all day.</p>

        <p><em>I delivered this sermon today at <a href="http://allsaintsamsterdam.church/">All Saints Amsterdam</a>.</em></p>

<p>A few months ago, along with much of humanity, it seemed, I went to see <em>Barbie</em>. Walking out of the theatre and forming an opinion on this intro to feminism, I renamed the film to a title which I will use again today: “Blueprints: a pamphlet against simplicity”.</p>

<p>It’s nice to see all of your faces here today. I’ve met most of you before, but let me make an official introduction. My name is Zinzy, I’m 35 years old, I live in Amsterdam, and I work in the tech industry. I’m an interaction designer at a medical technology company, which is to say that I design the ways in which doctors and nurses interact with my company’s software. My job is to find out how we can improve the lives of essential workers. It involves a lot of research, empathizing, and imagining. The phrase I repeat over and over again is: “How might we…?”</p>

<p>When people ask me how I came to have such a cool job, I always tell them about my degree in Comparative Literature, and the time I spent studying Theology. It never fails to throw them off. After all, what could be further apart than the literary canon and the abracadabra I do at work all day?</p>

<p>When it comes down to it, really, I just love a good story. I love looking at the ways in which we attempt to make sense of the world around us as well as the world within us. I like stories because of what they say about us. I like stories because we use them in our attempts to humanize others. The truest and sweetest opinion I have on humans is that we are storytelling animals.</p>

<p>When we tell a story, we take a reality (fictional or non-fictional), weave together its most important events and actors, and have our audience look at them through the eyes of one or more entities. To tell a story is an act of selection, of extraction from the truth what we deem important. To tell a story is to curate reality. To tell a story is to shape the world. We turn something complex into vehicles for education, entertainment, action. We abstract from <em>what is</em>, so our shared language is easy to comprehend.</p>

<p>Let me give you an example. Here are two stories about Jesus. One. God has a Son who is also God, he is perfect, and we will never be as good as him, but let’s try. Two. There was a baby born in humility, who grew up to be an inspiration to billions. He was murdered because people thought he was evil, but we never forgot his name. Two stories that invoke entirely different responses. Two stories that remind us that the storyteller is the one who holds the power.</p>

<p>Today, the story we’re telling each other is that of Christian saints. When Mpho suggested I preach about this, my thought process brought me from Mother Teresa via “oh-oh, I am certainly going to screw this up” to the most important commandment in the tech industry: ask why before you ask how.</p>

<p>Before we dive in, let me tell you what I <em>can’t</em> do today. I can’t do is tell you how I think reliving the stories of saints will get us into the Kingdom of Heaven. I can’t even tell you about my favorite saint, because I don’t have one. What I <em>can</em> do is share with you what I have: questions. Questions about questions. Questions about stories. Lots and lots of questions. Today, I hold onto what I know, how to build successful technology, to wade into what I don’t.</p>

<p>Saints. “These are the ones coming out of great tribulation” the lessons tell us. Throughout the centuries, first informally and locally, and then because Popes began restricting to themselves the right to canonize, we’ve collected hundreds upon hundreds of saints. Apostles, martyrs, confessors. Human beings who were perceived to have an exceptional degree of holiness, likeness, or closeness to God.</p>

<p>And today, still, many of us find inspiration in the stories about these people. They’re exemplary models, extraordinary teachers, wonder workers. They’re intercessors through whom we pray. Their stories are designed to inspire us into devotion, into serving God day and night in God’s temple, which is the world. When I think of it, saints <em>are</em> stories. After all, we never get the full picture, just what we’ve chosen is relevant enough to repeat.</p>

<p>These stories fall perfectly in step with the rhythm of Christianity, the rhythm of the Western world. The rhythm of looking for what we could have and could be. What we don’t have, and what we are not. Yet. We live in a culture of becoming. A culture, and a religion, of harder, better, faster, stronger. A culture of progression. Saints were designed to propel us towards the next best thing.</p>

<p>I’m no different from the culture in which I grew up: I love progress. I love growth, I love my learner’s mentality. I love that we use the saintly canon, a set of stories we’ve chosen to prioritize, to be better tomorrow than we are today. But there’s a flip side.</p>

<p>I struggle.</p>

<p>I struggle with saints, with how our tradition has curated, abstracted their human realities. I struggle with the fact that this is an effect of storytelling <em>at all</em>. I struggle with what happens when details go missing, when nuance is lost. I struggle with how, without details and nuance, we idealize as quickly as we devalue. The absence of details turn excellent <em>Harry Potter</em> books into pretty ok <em>Harry Potter</em> movies. It turns Mary Teresa, a sweet, charitable nun with questionable opinions on the realities of sexual violence in the Catholic church, into the pinnacle of female selflessness. It turns inhabitants of Gaza into terrorists. It turns Judaism into the root of all evil.</p>

<p>The art of storytelling is a sharp, double-edged sword. And I want to learn how to handle it more carefully, both as a speaker and as a listener.</p>

<p>I struggle with how stories about saints make us compare our insides to other people’s outsides. Even the word “saint” itself doesn’t necessarily invoke an atmosphere of reaching for the attainable. I struggle with this the same way I struggle with Beyoncé, who, at 23, won her first Grammy, an age at which I took five weeks to find the best typeface for my bachelor thesis.</p>

<p>I struggle with how I can’t see myself in the saints. And I need to see myself in someone to learn from them. As a queer person of color, I am intimately familiar with what it means when I can’t see myself in people. It invokes a sense of otherness, not a sense of community and hope. Color me a Christian millennial, but I learn from <em>mistakes</em>, not from other people’s highlight reels.</p>

<p>I know that, when it comes to the differences between veneration, adoration, admiration, idolatry, and worship, the Catechism of the Catholic Church will tell you I’m doing it wrong. I think that’s just her modus operandi. I don’t think I’m doing it wrong. I think there’s a flaw in the interaction design of how we’ve been taught to grow.</p>

<p>The lesson is this: you are not enough, other people are, and you should feel inspired to be more like them. Inspired by Jesus, Mother Teresa, St. Augustine, Beyonce, Stephen Hawking, Barbie, the Barbie, the resistance fighters. I don’t need a superhuman who can show me how to become more like them. I need a lifetime of flaws to remind me how to be a better me because someone else became a better them.</p>

<p>As a designer, I will forever defend the right of a design flaw to exist. In fact, if we ignore the design flaw, we’ll never be able to make things better. We must look at the problem before we come up with a solution. We must ask why before we ask how.</p>

<p>Why <em>might</em> we become better? And then:</p>

<p><em>How</em> might we use stories in a way that retains our individuality, our dignity, and leaves a margin for error, and room for doubt? How might we let the saints, all the names in the Bible, the very humans they were, inspire us to see ourselves in each other without concluding that we fail to imitate the blueprint?</p>

<p>How might we become better co-humans so that the Kingdom of Heaven is what we refer to when we say “wow, that was a really happy moment for me”? How might we do unto others as we would have them do unto us? How might we remember that <em>that</em> is the entire law, and the rest is just commentary?</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

  <li>First of all: not a great week. I continue to struggle to notice when I feel stresed or overwhelmed, and it never fails to result in my body giving me a clear sign. On Monday evening, in the midst of a busy work month, my body said “SIT. DOWN.” I needed undtil well into the weekend to feel myself again.</li>
  <li>One of the signs my body knows to give it a very mild version of conversion disorder: I lose the ability to listen to a conversation while I walk without feeling very dizzy. Isn’t the body a beautiful, very annoying, but magnificent thing?</li>
  <li>I start back up at work on Thursday, working the mornings until the weekend. It’s good to acknowledge things aren’t great., It brings clarity and rest.</li>
  <li>On Friday evening <a href="/2023/09/30/film-club-s01e01">I attend the first edition</a> of a new local film club I joined. It confirms what I already know: I love the horror genre, and I love discussing cinema with people who didn’t finish film school Anja I’m looking at you.</li>
  <li>Ever since we <a href="/2023/08/17/norway-et-al">visited Hija de Sanchez in Copenhagen</a> Anja and I have gotten really into Mexican food. By now, I’m so well-versed in the art of a simple-but-sublime taco, that I whip up a delicious meal. Who knew tacos required so little filling?</li>
  <li>On Saturday, I visit Micropia, a zoo-adjacent museum about microbes. I expect to be queasy throughout the entire visit, terrified by the unfortunate-looking mini animals that live in and on every part of my body. Instead, I’m amazed by the beauty of nature. During the mini class I ask a question about algae: if their bodies move towards light and they’re under a microscope for a while, where light comes from all sides, what happens to their health? The laboratory assistant tells me the museum swaps petri dishes regularly so that the algea don’t die. What happens before death, though, I wonder.</li>
  <li>On Sunday, Chenelva comes over for afternoon drinks. She’s one of those rare people: an instant connection and plenty of common ground to grow out friendship on. We marvel at how little we know about queer BIPOC Amsterdam.</li>
  <li>We’ve completed the first season of the Dutch reality show “B&amp;B vol liefde”, in which B&amp;B owners invite four dates into their home. Hate-watching reality television with Anja is one of my favorite pastimes.</li>

        <p>Yesterday, I attended the very first gathering of FC de Filmfanaten, a brand-new film club that my friend Jolien started. There were four of us, and we discussed the movie I was proud to have suggested: <em><span title="This points to a note, but it is private" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Talk To Me  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span></em>. I love speaking about films with others, and particularly with this diverse group of people. Everyone brought a completely unique perspective to the film, one brought film industry insights while the other had thoughtful ideas that I hadn’t considered.</p>

<p>Below are the notes I took (in Dutch).</p>

  <li>Cooler temperatures! After the hottest week I’ve experienced in months, things were back to comfortable Summer weather. By the time I’m writing this the sky is gray and it’s raining, but this week’s weather was cheerful and moderate.</li>
  <li>On Tuesday and Wednesday I gave two big UX workshops at week to help coworkers understand how they can use UX in their daily work. I’ve been giving workshops for well over a decade, always trusting my instinct to figure out what a particular group or context required. At work, though, we have two wonderful scrum masters who are well-versed in the art of facilitation. I learned a <em>lot</em> from their feedback, and saw a hugh jump between the quality of the first day and of the second day.</li>
  <li>I caught up with a special friend on Wednesday, a young woman I met because we were treated for the same health condition. Her life as a Psych major couldn’t be more different from mine, and yet the red threads our lives resemble one another. I’m fortunate to call her my friend.</li>
  <li>I had missed a few weeks in my RSS reader, but I was pleased to see Manuel Moreale’s <em><a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/">People &amp; Blogs</a></em> is off to a good start. To hell with Anja calling me a geek for being into the IndieWeb, I love visiting other people’s websites. I suspect I love reading what they have to say about those websites even more.</li>
  <li>Last week, I had met an amazing couple of lesbians who invited me over for a casual dinner party on Friday. After a particularly challenging week, it was comforting to hear their experiences as people of color in the world today. I’m already looking forward to inviting them to our place.</li>
  <li>On Saturday, Anja and I kicked off the weekend with a spontaneous redesign of our living room. We finally got rid of my desk, which was a Covid-era purchase used for our home office. What remains now is Anja’s bigger desk, which functions as a dining room table that she hates more than I do. The removal of our home office allowed us to place our sofa there, which has giving the living room a significant amount of extra space. The dining room table continues to double as an office whenever we put our ultrawide monitor there. I like <span title="This points to a note, but it is private" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  modular living  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span>, and I’m feeling less and less awkward about the way we’re going about it in our house.</li>
  <li>At the end of our cleaning sprint Anja mentioned it was a beautiful day for this accomplishment, since it was Rosh Hashanah. New living room, new beginnings.</li>
  <li>After visiting Anja’s mom in the afternoon, we biked to Kriterion to Watch <span title="This points to a note, but it is private" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Oppenheimer (2023)  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span>.</li>
  <li>Much like the last few days, I’m not in the best of states. There’s an old sadness that keeps saying hello, and I’m slowly beginning to think it might be time to get some help with it.</li>
  <li>I’m nearing the end of my journal, and I’m surprised by how unnervous I am by the few pages I have left. In this past, <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/7/12/20680004/notebook-journal-finish-strategies">like the rest of the world, as it appears</a>, I had trouble finishing a journal in a relaxed manner. Looking at the first entry, I see I have 29 days left until it’ll have been one year exactly. Hello nerves.</li>

  <li>IT IS HOT STOP CLIMATE CHANGE NOW. I don’t think I’ve seen hotter days this year than week 36. Getting out of a hot shower and feeling equally wet fifteen minutes later. Lemonade barely wanting to walk outside. The sun beaming so feriously we can’t keep the windows open. Thank you, Jesus, but please make it cooler.</li>
  <li>There’s something sweet about seeing Amsterdam through the eyes of friends from abroad. On Tuesday, I couldn’t have been more excited to welcome my <a href="https://vineandfig.co/">Vine &amp; Fig friends</a> Pickles and Patrick to the city. They’re two Irish Catholic gay men named Patrick, so we try to make it work any way we can.</li>
  <li>I was saddened by the fact that Jacob, Patrick’s husband, couldn’t make it because he had to stay home and help their dog Jude recover from surgery. All week, I felt like we were missing a limb.</li>
  <li>I joined the V&amp;F leadership team in mid 2020, and we’ve been growing a friendship since. The moment I saw them I knew we were going to get along perfectly in real life, too. Finally getting to embrace them felt like to most natural thing in the world.</li>
  <li>Their AirBnb, which is located just off of Vijzelgracht, was absolutely ridiculous. A three-bedroom penthouse overlooking De Pijp, enormous backyard below, include Swedish saunas and swimming pools. This is how the other half lives.</li>
  <li>I made time to hang out with the Patricks every day they were here, which took us to sweet places. I took them to <a href="https://takeichi-ramen.eu/">Takeichi</a>, my favorite ramen place where I always order anything but ramen, and to <a href="https://studio-k.nu/">Studio K</a>, where they met Lemonade, who chewed through her leash in what seemed like a quiet moment.</li>
  <li>On Friday, we went cheese and wine tasting at <a href="https://abrahamkef.nl/vestigingen/proeflokaal/">Abraham Kef in Noord</a>. It reminded me of how much I love cheese. It was the first thing I was able to say after I learned to say “momma”. I want to make my own cheese.</li>
  <li>After dinner at <a href="https://thuskomme.nl/">Thuskomme</a> on Saturday we took silly mugshots with my Polaroid camera.</li>
  <li>It is truly wonderful to spend time with the Patricks, with whom I weave in and out of conversation topics like it’s nobody’s business. One minute we’re talking about sex toys, and the next about the Book of Job. Knowing they were going to be leaving made me cry a little bit, but then I remembered our friendship had survived without physical get-togethers for three years already.</li>
  <li>On Friday, I met with Mpho to chat church business. I’ve been discerning all Summer about how I would want to be involved in the church now that it’s becoming a church plant, and I decided maintaining the website and social media was a commitment I could make.</li>
  <li>On Sunday, All Saints held her homecoming gathering after the Summer break. Kyle Rader, our new minister, was there for the first time. I liked the elder millennial vibe he brings to the service. It was intimate and lovely, although I seriously missed the pianist. After the service, we gathered for a potluck dinner in the bishop’s garden next to the church. I showed the logo ideas I had been working on, to friendly compliments.</li>

        <p>I saw a guy on Monday that I went on a date with once. It was one of those whimsical dates. We had fish by the sea. It felt like coming home a little bit. I think the world was trying to introduce me to something for which I wasn’t ready yet. Looking back, that date, more than the others, prepared me for Anja. Looking back through butterfly effect glasses, it might as well have been him.</p>

<p>Yesterday wasn’t a great day. They say recovery is a habit and it is. I was feeling quite low about myself. One hour at my friend’s citizenship party and I’d call it a night. Tomorrow would be full of things, too. Then he arrived. Like an old friend entering the scene.</p>

<p>As soon as I head over, we hug, and he begins telling me that he talks about me when he’s teaching storytelling, on an almost weekly basis, eight years on. “It’s when I begin to talk about tension-building” he says, and I laugh loudly, after which he eyebrows “you know what moment I’m talking about, right?” I say yes but I don’t. Back then, I was too drunk to really remember anything with accuracy.</p>

<p>He turns towards to his friends and continues. “I lean in to kiss her, but she rejects me. And I’m so nervous, thinking ‘gosh, did I really misread all the signs?!’” Apparently, then I said these words, which…:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wait. This is the last moment that you and I have never kissed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As he was telling this story, my entire body lit up. Partially turned on, but predominantly struck with delight. Who is that person? Can I have her number? Oh hold on, he’s talking about me.</p>

<p>Two things can be true at once, and for a moment, my experience of myself felt finely in balance. The universe can hold me as the asshole I see in myself, but also as the person whose butterfly wings can make a small change.</p>

<p>I spent the rest of the evening meeting kind strangers. White cis gay men who wanted to join the queer meetup I run, where my friend and I met. Kinfolk, effortlessly introduced as we blew <span title="This points to a note, but it is private" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Cat whisper  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span>s at each other.</p>

<p>My friend looked stunning. An impeccable sense of style, a smile larger than the world, a citizenship bigger than we’d ever ask of him. I knew he was suspended mid-air in all sorts of areas of his life, but, looking at him, I suspected he had arrived somewhere long before any of us ever would.</p>

<p>Today, grabbing coffee in the neighborhood, I meet an acquaintance who’s on sabbatical until the end of the year, spending his time taking action lessons, storytelling workshops.  I ask him if he has ever heard of the girl who almost rejected a kiss by the sea and he bursts out laughing.</p>

  <li>Met <span title="This points to a note, but it is private" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Tim Bleeker  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span> at <span title="This points to a note, but it is private" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Somerlust Park  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span> on <span title="This points to a note, but it is private" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  2023-08-22|Tuesday  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span>, a get-together that started as “chilling in the park”, and which turned into grabbing a drink at l’Osteria. The venue is not one I can recommend. When requesting a bigger table because more people would be coming, the waiter scoffed at us. Then he closed the red velvet roped entrance. Later, his colleague told me people often just barge into the venue, ignoring waiters’ requests. I couldn’t imagine the type of person that would do this, and then I looked around.</li>
  <li>I still seem to have a pinguecula because of <a href="/2023/07/22/norway-et-al-2023/">the time I spent in an airconditioned car not too long ago</a>, although my eye is far less red than last week. I feel guilty for disgusting any reader with this information, but hey, they’re weeknotes. Long story short, I now have sunglasses.</li>
  <li>Watched <em><span title="This points to a note, but it is private" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Hillsong, A megachurch exposed  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span></em>, and learned a lot about how the church has propelled itself into popularity. Knowing how anti-queer the church has always been, I never felt comfortable attending a service in Amsterdam. The early 10s fashion made me feel nostalgic, though.</li>
  <li>Had a lovely workshop at work about effective team work. It was inspiring, educational, and great for a sense of collaboration, not just with my peers, but also with the company’s leadership. It’s wonderful to be a part of a company that walks its talk so enthusiastically.</li>
  <li>I’m struggling to be a good dog mom to Lemonade, seeing Anja’s conduct and training as much more effective and kind. I’ve been working to praise her good behavior more than I punish her mistakes.</li>
  <li>I was off on <span title="This points to a note, but it is private" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  2023-08-25|Friday  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span>, and I went to an early-morning showing of <em><span title="This points to a note, but it is private" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Talk to Me (2023)  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span></em>, which I’ll most likely do again. A cute retired Amsterdam couple were discussing their elaborate weekend cooking plans, which I found delighting. They proceeded to talk all throughout the movie.</li>
  <li>I tidied <span title="This points to a note, but it is private" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Annelie Wambeek  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span>’s house now that she’s coming back from her month abroad. I brought her some eggs, bread, milk, some treats, and flowers, and I made sure to leave the house smelling fresh. I hope it makes her feel good when she comes home tonight.</li>
  <li>I spent Saturday and Sunday <a href="/2023-08-27-12-43-45">tinkering on the website</a>, and feel good about the results.</li>
  <li>I’ve been on the hunt for a good strategy for <span title="This points to a note, but it is private" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Bible study  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span> in <span title="This points to a note, but it is private" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Obsidian  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span>, and I managed to find a verse-per-file translation of the <span title="This points to a note, but it is private" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  King James Bible  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span> on <a href="https://faithbasedproductivity.com/cross-reference-library-obsidian/">FaithBasedProductivity.com</a> that I added to my Obsidian vault. It took a couple of days before the whole thing was properly synced across my devices, which I suspect might be the result of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/112ynkj/background_sync_on_ios/">Obsidian Sync not be able to perform background syncs</a>. It made me consider switching to iCloud Sync for a second, but honestly I can’t be bothered. I’m keen to see when I’ll actually begin using the 33,613 files that are taking up over 100 mb in my vault.</li>
  <li>I found myself missing church this week. I’m excited for <a class="internal-link" href="/2023/02/12/all-saints-amsterdam">All Saints Amsterdam</a> to start back up again mid-September. I’m curious to see what’s in store for us.</li>
  <li><span title="This points to a note, but it is private" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Mark Delany  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span> came over for Lemonade cuddles and dinner on <span title="This points to a note, but it is private" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  2023-08-26|Saturday  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span>. I made <span title="This points to a note, but it is private" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Tacos  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span>, successfully if I do say so myself, and we had a lovely time catching up and discussing what really matters: the fact that Mark uses the word “taco” as a standard synonym for female genitalia. I’m still laughing.</li>

  <li>The first week back at work is fairly quiet, I even found myself on the verge of boredom at one point. Organically, this makes me feel bad, but I remind myself that weeks before and after holidays tend to have this effect on my life. I tell myself I’m just landing.</li>
  <li>No one can convince me the municipality of Amsterdam <em>isn’t</em> using major construction projects to show tourists how crap the city can be. On Sunday, I go for a long bike ride to Amsterdamse Bos and back, and crossing the Berlagebrug I’m struck by how quiet the street is without cars racing by. I like it.</li>
  <li>I finished watching <em>[[The Righteous Gemstones]]</em>, and I miss them already.</li>
  <li>Anja’s still off for the summer, and I’m watching her slowly recover from being my personal chauffeur for two weeks</li>
  <li>The Summer makes me not want to cook. It’s no help that I’m using <a href="https://anneliewambeek.com/">Annelie</a>’s apartment to work while she’s travelling, and that I use the occasion to order poke bowls for lunch. I’m surprised by the quality of <a href="https://pokeperfect.nl/en/amsterdam/linnaeusstraat/">Poke Perfect</a>’s teriyaki chicken bowl, extra edamame.</li>
  <li>I’m reading and enjoying Robin Meyer’s <em>[[Saving Jesus From the Church]]</em>, a tool to make my interest in [[orthopraxy]] more tangible.</li>

        <p>I am notorious for never grasping how many people know how much about what. To save myself from any further embarrassment I won’t spend my time here telling you what the app is about. The team does that nicely over here. I do think I have something to say about what Scriptogr.am came exactly at the right time for me.</p>

<p>As we more further down the line of Web 2.0 and slowly into the abyss that is Web 3.0, I feel the definitions of web design are evolving greatly. I remember back in the day when it was just one website out of fifty that looked really beautiful, and how I would spend many hours on the site just being surrounded by all the pretty. Now, as more and more distinct design trends are emerging, looking pretty isn’t the main goal anymore. It has become a criterium. And most websites I know meet that criterium in one way or another. Now that the eyes have what they need, the user wants for the website to be up to speed with their brain.</p>

<p>And this is where websites fail.</p>

<p>Not all websites have the potential of being minimalist, small and clean code-wise. Pardon me if I say that the designers might know ways to get there, but experience tells me clients always manage to come up with ways to make a code more extensive than it should be. So, some of the websites I am talking about can be exempt from my suggestion. But certainly, and most of all, I am talking about the weblog. A place where, once in 1992, a HTML page and new words every now and then would suffice. We have come a long way from that simple structure. Now, with everybody tuning into Wordpress, Drupal, and Tumblr for ready-made templates and every single widget known to man, I feel I’m becoming more and more detached from simple, beautiful web design and UI.</p>

<p>Scriptogr.am, to me, is a great answer. It gives me very few options: I can write, display some links, even add an image if I like, but that is as far as I am gonna go. There are no custom archives, last.fm user grids, Flickr photo streams or twenty PHP pages I can configure any way I want to. It is me, my words, a few nice web fonts, a few links, and the ease of writing from anywhere in a cloud. Scriptogr.am allows me to ask myself a question I was afraid to ask myself for a long time: why does my website need every available function? Why do blogs take up so much space?</p>

<p>This website is now as much a personal space as it is a manifest and an experiment. In the upcoming weeks or months I will experience what it is like to use one app that is always with me and directly upload content to my website without having to do much beside write. I truly believe that, as a blogger (whether you are a professional or an absolute amateur like me), it is crucial to know how much effort writing a blog should take. In my opinion, it should take very little. Not only because it is simply too much work, but also because I’ve learnt that keeping my blog beautiful and cool became more important than actually writing on it.</p>

<p>Let’s see how this goes.</p>

        <p>I love a good media drama. Like a moth to a flame, or perhaps more accurately like a fly to dog poo, I am drawn to it. I check the news multiple times a day. I scoff at outlets that don’t deem it worthy of the front page. I also scoff at outlets that do. A media drama can antagonize me the way Adele disappoints me with her popularity.</p>

<p>The fact that I’m part of a Titanic/<em>Titanic</em>-obsessed gaggle of netizens somehow has me convinced I’m not just procrastinating. Five men with money — sums of it — on their way to Titanic in a little titanium box, are lost at sea. To empathize, the world holds her breath.</p>

<p>Growing up without my father, I never gave much thought to the reality in which he once found himself, well over half a century ago. Ten years old, him and his football team of siblings, on a boat, lost at sea. I wonder if the five men ever saw Titanic. I wonder if they cried.</p>

<p>I imagine he was lost at sea the way only a child can be: cursed with the spirit of adventure. Where did the boat depart from? Did he bring a toy? Was there a tiger? The only way I can read the scene is with the poetry of someone who’ll never know what it’s like to leave home when home is the mouth of a shark.</p>

<p>The Internet continues her wailing. Debris is found. The 19-year-old had only tagged along to make Father’s Day one to remember. I don’t know the story about my father’s father. I never celebrated a proper Father’s Day. My father’s father was long dead before the boat was put out to sea. Yes?</p>

<p>A Dutch news site tells me, at the bottom in small font, about their podcast episode. Who is responsible for the boat refugees who drowned off the Greek coast? Could we leave their bodies on the ocean floor? On Reddit, people share animated maps of the football team of rescue boats circling Titanic.</p>

<p>I love a good media drama. Like a moth to a flame, or perhaps more accurately like a fly to dog poo, I am drawn to it. Like a mosquito it drowns out the other humming. Like a natural disaster it refrigerates the other stories, the puzzles I fear I will never solve.</p>

        <p>Every time I embark on a journey towards a published post about why it’s good to have a website, I get lost in the reality of personal details. Everyone has different reasons for believing something. Aiming to take them all into account doesn’t help me write anything that feels worthwhile and not like a derivative<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>You should have a personal website not because you need to grow an audience, and turn your hobbyist writing into a profession.</p>

<p>You should have a personal website not because you’re an expert on some subject, and it would be cruel to deny the world your wisdom.</p>

<p>You should have a personal website not because you think you’re important.</p>

<p>You should have a personal website not because the world is in need of your highlight reel.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You should have a personal website because I think the online world is as real as the offline world. You have a presence in one, and you should have a presence in the other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider your personal website an online living room of sorts. The place that displays, in a variety of ways, who you are, what you care about, and how you’re moving through the world.</p>

<p>You’re free to invite anyone to come in, and have them see anything you deem relevant. They can stay for three seconds and walk out the door, or dwell for a bit, opening drawers, going back in time, answering questions, questioning answers.</p>

<p>Imagine that there are people on the other side of the world who would want to know how you’re doing, what you’re thinking and learning. Not because you’re you, per se, but simply because you have in common the habit of sharing your experiences in an online space where you are the boss.</p>

<p>There is a <em>cozy web</em> out there, where people connect simply because they enjoy snacking on each other’s slices of life: the seemingly unimportant moments, words, images that approximate what it means to be human.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imagine, also, what it means when I say “you are the boss”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Think of how little you control about yourself on the Internet. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.nl</code> website of your name is already registered, but are you its owner? I doubt it. Your company has a portrait of you on their website, and it’s beautiful, but you can’t add anything to the page it’s on, can you?</p>

<p>You have an updated LinkedIn page and it’s a great way for people to find you, but do you live to work or work to live? Besides, it’s LinkedIn designers who decide for you what your profile will look like. If you’d ever want to do anything other than write a post or update your experiences, you’re out of luck.</p>

<p>There’s an old newsletter containing an interview with you, again with that wonderful portrait. It’s probably because of your work that this is all I can find on you. It makes me sad, Nienke, it does.</p>

<p>You know why? I love learning about what you’re up to. And I suspect the places where you share that are social media profiles that don’t necessarily use your full name. It’s great for privacy, of course, I get it. But I don’t want to be on social media to stay in your loop.</p>

<p>Or rather, I want social media to be our websites. You read mine and I read yours, we write comments on our own websites and they’re posted to each other’s websites automatically.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Twitter can fall, Instagram can crumble, LinkedIn can add an expensive subscription model, but you and I will still have our websites.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want you to take up space on the Internet, Nienke.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I want you to enjoy doing so and perhaps even making new connections in the process. I want you to learn how to build your own website and tell me in a year that it’s actually much easier than you thought. I want you to feel empowered. And to have a <a href="/now">now</a> page, and to keep lists on your websites of things you love in Amsterdam and beyond.</p>

<p>I want you to feel that you can escape the rat race of likes, favs, and reposts. I think what you have to say is worth more than the hipness of some platform.</p>

<p>I want you to fall in love with personal websites so much that you write about it on your website, and tell people about it at Coffee Company.</p>

<p>I want to share with you the wonderful community of random people from all over the world, who are so much more curious and enthusiastic, so genuinely supportive, and so much kinder than any of the communities I’ve ever found on Big Tech platforms.</p>

<p>I want to read what you have to say about the world when you stop worrying what your blog should be called.</p>

        <p>It’s late in the morning and I’m on my way to Gerimedica, the company’s I’m excited to be joining in May, which is next week already. I’m on my bike listening to an American podcast about the history of Dutch anarchist cycling culture.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> The scene could only be more Dutch if I had a frying pan with bitterballen on the back of my bike.</p>

<p>The commute is wonderful: it takes me from the East side of Amsterdam via De Pijp and Vondelpark to perhaps the most beautiful building I’ve ever had the privilege of calling my office. I cross the river Amstel, enjoy the sun, and marvel at the preparations people have been making.</p>

<p>In two days, King’s Day is upon us. It’s always a big event in the country, and specifically in Amsterdam, and this year it’s extra special: our king was coronated ten years ago this year. In our house it’s not a big deal, in fact Anja couldn’t be more of an anti-monarchist if she tried. Lemonade’s too young to pay it any mind, I’m sure. But the rest of the country is getting ready.</p>

<p>King’s Day is full of traditions: young children playing the violin out of tune at the park, tompouce pastries, the king and his family on a heavily-televised trip to a Dutch city that has been preparing for this moment for a year. And forever and for always: people securing a spot on the flea market route days ahead of time.</p>

<p>Today, as I biked across the city, I saw hundreds of them; 40 square feet of pavement taped off by people aiming to use that specific spot to spend their King’s Day. Peddling by, I thought to myself that it was a rather sweet unwritten rule: I put my name here in a manner that you could erase at any moment, but Dutch custom says you’re to honor my plan.</p>

<p>I’m used to people marking these spots “bezet” (“taken”) or adding their name for emphasis. Today, however, I noticed many people had made a small figure with their tape, a maker’s mark of sorts. I’m learning through Anja’s ceramics adventure that this is entirely common in the potter community: a small, minimalist figure telling the world you made something.</p>

<p>I hope all those people get what they came for: that specific spot on the pavement, and a fun day to help them Konmari their house. In the meantime, I also hope that the Amsterdamse Bos is quiet on King’s Day. I’m looking to take Anja and Lemonade there for a quiet afternoon, far away from the crowds.</p>

        Spring is here, I think? I spend the afternoon in the park with ex-colleague-turned-friend Susan, who is celebrating landing a new and challenging job. There's a boy in the park who's walking around barefoot. Later we see him on a zipline. I like this scene; it tells me that summer is almost upon us.

        <p>Lemonade, Lemonade, Lemonade. Who knew I would ever become a dog person? Two weeks ago, we picked up our corgi Lemonade Zelda Loulé. There was a torrent of research both Anja and I did to prepare for this puppy. There was a birth announcement card. A <a href="https://www.anneliewambeek.com/">godmother</a> was appointed. Here are some things I learned after two weeks with a dog.</p>

I have never been inside this particular church building before, and chuckle at how <em>new</em> the Old Catholic decor is: in imagery and candle lighting possibilities it’s reminiscent of the average Dutch Roman Catholic church. Its white walls and central heating tell me something different.</p>

<p>Living in a good neighborhood has many advantages. One of them is that it makes me want to spend a lot of time there. Saturday morning is very likely my favorite day in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>I get up, without an alarm, around 6:30, engage in some morning writing, and fanny around the house for a bit. I take a shower at 7:45, and walk to my favorite coffee place at 08:20. Sometimes I wait outside for a few minutes until their doors open at 08:30.</p>

<p>“Medium decaf mocaccino, half cow’s milk, half Tony Chocolonely.” I say it, but none of the baristas need reminding. Sometimes I bring my computer to work on my personal site, sometimes I bring a book and my diary. I’m not the only one who lives Saturday mornings like this.</p>

<p>This morning I hung out, drawing people who were conducting a similar Saturday morning routine. A great start to the weekend.</p>

        <p>Walking with Annelie is coffee indoors today. We’ve told each other we need to go on more walks. She asks if we should dress warmly for the cold, wet park, or if we should just grab a table inside. Normally at this hour, Coffee Company is packed to the brim with digital nomads, so “dress for cold, hope for warmth” I say. Miraculously, there are two tables from which we can choose.</p>

<p>I’m so proud of the work Annelie has been doing, <a href="https://www.anneliewambeek.com/">building a business from scratch</a>, and wrapping her head around how she can do her best work. We discuss productivity; tools, methods, apps, Etsy calendar print-outs. Today, I tell her how much <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@elizabethfilips">Elizabeth Filips</a> has been helping me. We decide we should join <a href="https://www.meetup.com/shutupandwriteamsterdam/">Shut Up &amp; Write</a> sometime.</p>

<p>It was clear from the start to both Anja and I that Annelie would make a great godmother for <a href="http://lemonade.waleson.us/">Lemonade the puppy</a>. We’ve decided to go full over-the-top with anything dog-related, and luckily Annelie is more than happy to review my birth announcement card options. She couldn’t radiate more enthusiasm about this dog if she tried. And she hasn’t even met her yet.</p>

<p>As we shmoozed over coffee, I was reminded of the time when doing this indoors wasn’t even possible. I remember the Coffee Company line going all the way around the block, the overflowing trash bins with paper coffee cups, the increasing amount of fresh air we were all taking in. It’s nice to spend time indoors again, but I do miss the park. I can’t wait for spring to start.</p>

        <p>January flew, <em>flew</em> by, I tell you. We started with “wow, 2023 already, let’s have a chill time this year, hey what’s on Netflix?” and at the time of writing everything is different:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Things are not chill, because we’re preparing ourselves, our lives, and our house for our first-ever puppy</li>
  <li>Both our work lives are unexpectedly bustling and busy</li>
  <li>We cancelled Netflix</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve been saying for years that I’d be willing to pay 100 euros a month for a single, all-encompassing international streaming platform. I suppose it’s never going to happen, but, hey, at least we’ll have that puppy, right?</p>

<h3 id="the-puppy">The puppy!</h3>
<p>Like I said, we kicked off the year very quietly, thinking “meh, someone asked us if we wanted a puppy, but we’re not really sure just yet.” This all changed ones we learned that eight healthy puppies were born and we were allowed to pick first. <a href="/2023/01/15/sneak-preview/">We went for a visit</a> mid-January, and fell deeply in love with little Lemonade, who’s coming home at the end of February.</p>

<p>I went from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogfree/">serious dog-free advocate</a> to an expecting dog parent in two months’ time, and I suppose it’s safe to say I’ve gone a bit mad. I’m designing a birth announcement card, and <a href="https://lemonade.waleson.us/">the puppy may or may not already have a website</a>. Help me.</p>

<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>I picked up a few great titles at the <a href="https://www.oba.nl/openingstijden/detail.199270.html/oba-oosterdok/">library</a> this month. One that was helpful to get through was, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/15733923"><em>Loose Cannons Back on Track</em></a>, about managing gifted neurodivergence in the workplace. At the moment, I’m thoroughly enjoying <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/321863.One_Continuous_Mistake"><em>One Continuous Mistake: Four Noble Truths for Writers</em></a> by Gail Sher.</p>

<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
<p>Musically, the year is off to a great start. I’ve made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-INeMspNSQ0">a new Brian Eno discovery</a> that’s hard not to love, found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMJm_97QXHA">Mitski gem</a> that has been on repeat, and added a great track to my work playlist: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2qsU8FGU_E">Tieduprightnow by Parcels</a>. As always, I’ve compiled a playlist of all of these and more. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6Xlr2LlyTQuCdgWd46KNUI?si=980c41a80e134089">Feel free to check it out</a>.</p>

<p>I saw <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7322224/"><em>Triangle of Sadness</em></a> again this month, and loved it more than I did the first time. I appreciate how well this movie understands the finality of our social roles, and how, at the same time, they can be transformed in the blink of an eye. In addition, I am secretly a 13-year-old boy who likes to look at people drowning in their own vomit and excrement.</p>

<p>Anja and I also began watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15677150/"><em>Shrinking</em></a>, which is surprisingly fun. ‘Men’s liberation movement’ like <em>Ted Lasso</em>, but ever so slightly more depressing and realistic.</p>

<h3 id="something-else">Something else</h3>
<p>I find myself looking for great influencers focused on gifted neurodivergence. Like those many awesome YouTubers sharing tips and tricks on how to live with ADHD, but for giftedness, and not in some Mensa kind of way, but just something that’s honest about the challenges one may encounter. Most of what I find is written by pedagogues for parents of gifted children. If you know of anything, feel free to <a href="/hello">let me know</a>.</p>

        <p>There’s a woman who runs a <a href="https://www.athenaeum.nl/winkels/zuidoost">bookshop in De Bijlmer</a>. She has kind eyes that make you want to curl up with a book and a cup of tea. Often when I’m there, she offers just that: tea, and a place to quiet down and dive into an interesting title. She’s running a fine business over there, Cole Verhoeven is.</p>

<p>Aside from bookshop owner she’s also a writer. I love the work she does at <a href="https://www.oneworld.nl/">One World</a>, where she articulates <a href="https://www.oneworld.nl/lezen/opinie/witte-fragiliteit-bestaat-niet/">strong perspectives</a> <a href="https://www.oneworld.nl/lezen/discriminatie/sociaal-onrecht/woke-ooit-een-waarschuwing-voor-racisme-nu-een-conservatief-hondenfluitje/">on antiracism</a> <a href="https://www.oneworld.nl/lezen/opinie/kamala-harris-is-niet-de-eerste-geschikte-zwarte-vrouw/">and equity</a>. A few weeks ago, she sold me this book:</p>

    </div>
</div>

<p>When I took it from the shelf, I didn’t know she was the one who wrote it. Eventually, she told me she had drawn inspiration from the questions her child asks her. The questions often leave her bemused, surprised, stunned. I suppose they’re the questions we forget to ask as we grow older.</p>

<p>It’s a perfect coffee table book, deserving of a central place in the house to welcome guests into an atmosphere of curiosity and whimsy.</p>

<p>One page that stands out to me is this one. There must have been countless times I wondered similar things as a child. Why are the garbage men brown? Why do all the other colored people live on the other side of the tracks? Why don’t I see myself on television?</p>

<p>I imagine the life of Cole’s child, growing up in this part of history, with a Black parent at home to raise him, in one of the most diverse cities in Europe. Access to a Black-owned bookshop that helps people see themselves in others. It makes me feel equal parts envy and calm.</p>

        <p>My attempt to lure both Anja and myself outside for some fresh air and a walk was thwarted as soon as I learned the place was out of my favorite bubble tea. We strolled to Flevopark, in my hand an ice cream cone, and on my face the disappointment of a toddler who can’t be satisfied.</p>

<p>The park has a wide field that allows loose dogs to roam freely in the off-season. Even through the trees Anja and I spotted the corgi from half a mile away.</p>

<p>“I mean, we could just go up and chat a little, right? She might have some good tips?” Anja and I wondered, looking for an excuse to get closer to the dog. We must have looked completely adorable, because the face of Kenny’s owner brightened once she noticed us lingering nearby.</p>

<p>She told us about their routine, how he could already stay home alone for most of the day, and how she’d had never heard him bark. Within minutes we learned we all know Lalo, another corgi in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>It’s nice getting to know this new corner of the neighborhood. She and I are dog people now.</p>

        <p>We had two friends over today. They’re dear to me specifically because we got to know each other intimately during our eating disorder recovery. We promised we’d one day get together and watch <em>Love Actually</em>, much-beloved by each of us.</p>

<p>I’ve developed a habit of watching this film at least once a year. Despite its soft romcomness, homogenous cast, and general lack of depth it has taught me volumes on relationships. I love it more with each viewing.</p>

<p>Today, for the first time, perhaps, I saw its fat-phobia for what it really is. It left a sour taste in my mouth; one that reminds me I’m not the audience of the film, or at least not part of the audience who should feel good after the credits begin to roll.</p>

<p>It’s annoying to see how a home cinema afternoon can make my body experience drop so significantly. I suppose if there’s any month in the year to be confronted with this, it would be International Diet Culture Month, ay?</p>

        <p>On occasion, Anja will compliment me on my ability to recognize people. I don’t know when I first noticed it myself, but there are actors I recognize even if they played minor characters in an episode of a show I watched 15 years ago. Or I might point out that woman I saw on the bus before COVID hit to a confused Anja.</p>

<p>I’m learning it’s not a very common trait because of the scoffing sound I make whenever Anja confuses Keira Knightly and Daisy Ridley, or Michelle Pfeiffer and Meg Ryan. I only recently became aware how much of a jerk that makes me, and how, if we were in a room full of people, I’d stick out like a sore thumb.</p>

<p>I’ve wondered if I could be classified as a super-recognizer. I remember taking the test a few years ago and stopping halfway through, fearing that I’d see the faces of the people in my dreams and nightmares for all of eternity.</p>

    <content> 
      
        <p>This morning I got acquainted with the immigrant anxiety felt by Chinese-American journalist Jiayang Fan about her desire to speak accentless English. In <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/786/its-a-game-show">an episode of one of my favorite podcasts, <em>This American Life</em></a>, Jiayang participated in a game show designed around a talent she claims to possess: the unique ability, inspired by her anxiety, to tell at what age a Chinese-American person came to the United States. The show gave her recordings of three people to prove herself. (She got 0 out of 3.)</p>

<p>Nothing human is alien to me, and neither is Jiayang’s desire to blend in phonetically.</p>

<p>Growing up in the Dutch South, I wasn’t ever unaware of my accent, but it took me enrolling in Utrecht University to become fully aware of the effect it had on others. I could barely make it through class participation without someone chuckling in the back row of lecture hall. I decided that, on the very day I found housing in Utrecht, I would change my accent. These days, few people can tell I’m from the South. I like it that way.</p>

<p>Another thing I’ve always been afraid to sound was “black”. In the Netherlands, that usually means sounding like you were born and (partially) raised in an African country, Suriname, or the Antilles. With no such history, I’m silly to think I could ever fall into that category, which is a fine category in itself. Still, every now and then people will tell me I sound Surinamese. Unable to shake my internalized racism, I always find myself offended when they do.</p>

<p>Today’s episode reminded me of the duality of being a person of color in a conversation about speech. Like Jiayang, I find myself comparing my speech to that of other Black people, forming opinions on what I think is or isn’t “good”. At the same time, I would find it problematic if other, non-Black people were doing it for me. To me, there’s nothing inherently wrong in that distinction; it’s important people can tell their own story and not have it told for them. I’m just struck by the number of times I asked “babe, is this the example we want to give?”</p>

        <p>Sometimes, when bad news arrives, I think to myself “argh, just when I was beginning to think life was nice and steady!” Today is one of those days. I’m immediately thrown off, though mostly by the scenarios playing out in my head. Not because of the particular fact of which I learn.</p>

<p>I’m disappointed by the rediscovery of life’s unsteadiness. At the same time, there’s beauty to be found. After all, there have been times in my life when I’ve been so anxious that bad news wasn’t an interruption, but a confirmation of what I already thought I knew.</p>

<p>Today, a cloud blocks the sun. I remind myself that it’s a whole lot better than rain all year round.</p>

        <p>In a few days, I’ll hit my one-month mark on the piano. When I bought it and began playing, I made sure to keep an open mind about how I learn best; not following any particular method, but tailoring practices to my interests, speed, challenges, and desires.</p>

<p>One learning strategy that always works best for me is a top-down approach. With the piano, there’s great benefit in playing music from sheets (of which I’m capable), but I could tell something had been missing. This morning, as I woke early once again, this time at 03:20 a.m., I realized the missing part was an overview of which chords work in a particular key.</p>

<p>This morning over coffee at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ccjavaplein">my favorite spot</a>, I did some digging and found <a href="https://piano-music-theory.com/">Piano-Music-Theory.com</a>, which has a wonderful series on diatonic chords. If you’re not familiar, these are chords belonging to notes that make up a particular scale. Knowing the diatonic chords of each scale is going to benefit my flexibility on the piano, because I’ll be able to play songs in whichever key I need.</p>

<p>As I was drawing up a matrix of what I was learning, I remembered how special music theory really is. I love its intricacy and depth, and how it manages to capture one of life’s most extraordinary things: combinations of sounds that can tell a story.</p>

        <p>More than any other time in my online life am I aware of the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text. I make a point to write image descriptions whenever I can. Kind strangers with a variety of accessibility needs have been helping me understand how to best capture my interpretation of an image. I’ve come to regard <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text as the secret side bar I get to have with blind people and others who need it.</p>

<p>For me, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text raises interesting cultural questions, particularly around its growing visibility. Traditionally, it requires that people who don’t use accessibility tools hover an image to produce what I call “the world’s slowest tooltip”. In addition, I’ve been seeing a growing number of people work <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text into places where it doesn’t exist. Places that don’t require a hover. Two examples of this are <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@zinzy">Mastodon</a>’s profile and banner images.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I saw the profile picture of a young woman winking. Her bio captured the image with something along the lines of “young woman looking seductively at the camera, winking, and slightly sticking out her tongue hoping to engage the viewer”. Before reading that text I felt engaged indeed, my mind painting a quick image of what her manic pixie dream girl university campus life would be like.</p>

<p>Reading her description of the image had an effect. I gather it was the overtness — her self-awareness about what the image could convey — that somehow put me off just slightly. The image and not so much her description of it but the very fact that I could even see that description, and that she understood I would, changed how I saw her in the image. It also changed how I see the Internet.</p>

<p>What does it mean, I’ve been thinking ever since, that people with no need for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text get to peek behind its curtain? What effect can this form of double meaning-making have? Does it mean we’ll eventually go on to describe images differently, knowing that not a portion of our audience but the entirety of it is looking on? Does it mean we may, some day, try to say less with imagery? In one way, I’d consider that reduction of fluff a triumph for accessibility.</p>

<p>Today, Piper Haywood’s blog <a href="https://piperhaywood.com/wais-alt-decision-tree/">put me onto a handy <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text decision tree</a>. I’m entirely surprised to read that the answer to the final question in the tree, “Is the image purely decorative or not intended for the user?”, is “use an empty <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code>” and not “don’t post the image”.</p>

<p>I guess that paints the best picture of how much of a reductionist I am.</p>

        <p>Have you heard? Anja and I are getting a dog. It was up in the air for a little while, but we got the confirmation yesterday that we’ll get first pick of a nest of eight adorable little Pembroke - Cardigan corgi mixes. We’re meeting the puppies for the first time on Sunday. Are you crying? I’m crying.</p>

<p><a href="/2022/12/30/2022-in-review/">2022 showed me</a> that there are serious drawbacks to being an A type personality. The way it helps Anja and I prepare for a puppy isn’t one of them.

<p>Annoyingly, I’ve now become one of those people who thinks they know a minuscule sliver of the dread expecting parents must feel, aiming to read all of the world’s parenting books before retiring on the idea that, at the end of the day, it’s all about intuition and consistency.</p>

        <p>In one of the many jubilant reviews garnered by Darren Aronofsky’s latest film <em>The Whale</em>, one writer concluded that we shouldn’t judge a book by its cover. This was in reference to the morbidly obese main character who eventually dies, but not before we find out he developed an eating disorder out of grief. Here was a fat man who evidently had feelings despite his exterior. Ironically, I find myself doing just what the writer suggested I don’t: judge the film before I’ve seen it.</p>

<p>As a fat person, I’m surprised to have forgotten some of the tropes society has formulated about bodies like mine. It might be the time I’ve spent recovering from an eating disorder, my underuse of popular (and harmful) social media, or my Blur It Out browser extension, but I apparently had been living in a kinder world. Everything about <em>The Whale</em> puts a damper on that experience.</p>

<p>Many may marvel at Brendan Fraser’s stellar performance, I see a minstrelsy of fatness. While undoubtedly not its primary purpose, <em>The Whale</em> reminds fat people that life is absolutely different for people who are not like us. Non-fat people can use the film to reconcile with fatness, to see the humanity behind the physical. Fat people can get reacquainted with how they’re supposed to see themselves, employing <em>The Whale</em> for scale.</p>

        <p>I have a feeling 2023 will be the year for weird movies that steal our hearts. Look at <em>Triangle of Sadness</em> and <em>White Noise</em>. Here you have two high-budget oddball films that I’d describe not as mumblecore but coastercore, pulling you from one weird subnarrative into another, not really making up their minds about what they are, and before you’ve formed a full opinion on it, the ride is over, but you loved it.</p>

<p>It reminds me of the dawn of black brutalist typefaces mixed with pastel and neon gradients in web design: you look at it and your body says “wtf” and your heart goes “yes”.</p>

<p>I’ll await further data to see if I have any type of a point.</p>
