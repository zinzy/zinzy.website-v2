          <p>I never get much reading done unless I’m sleeping elsewhere. Most often, I associate sleeping elsewhere with having time off, and having time off means I’m away from a computer screen. This frees up time for reading.</p>

<p>A had booked a suite for my birthday at Okura, and six months after I turn 33, Covid measures are finally so mild that we actually get to do it. It’s on the sixteenth floor, overlooking the Amsterdam Centre and West Side. We eat like royalty, and fall asleep watching the sunset from our California King. I’m feeling like a million bucks.</p>

<p>Whenever we sleep elsewhere, I get overwhelmed with the endless possibilities of the things I can read. Usually, I manage to sneak five books into a suitcase, but for this weekend, I’ve limited myself to one: _<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/42452986">Mary Magdalene Revealed</a>.</p>

<p>It’s a remarkable read, particularly given that the author Meggan Watterson got an MDiv and not an MFA in writing. Her words flow like a river, entirely sure of where she’s going. Every now and then, I’ll read a portion aloud to A, to share the joy of reading a theological work that is as inclusive and self-aware as it is unreserved and educational.</p>

<p>As I share snippets of insights, revelations in sweat lodges as well as things I never knew about the beauty of early Christianity, A asks me: “Don’t you find this book a bit… <em>The Da Vinci Code</em>-esque? I mean, all this talk of Mary Magdalene’s special relationship with Jesus, alternative plot lines… It’s like it’s all one big conspiracy theory, wouldn’t you say?”</p>

<p>A’s not the only woman who has made such remarks about this book. Isn’t it peculiar that feminists would rather deem femininity-inclusive gospels closer to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1400331">possibly the worst book in the English language that has emerged in the past decade</a> than to a perspective on Christ that could cure our heartaches?</p>

          <p>I am nostalgic about the way the Web used to be. I miss the handcrafted blogs that I used to visit, and the intimate windows they gave me into the lives of strangers.</p>

<p>I miss that I knew all the domain names by heart. It is a phantom pain of sorts; an unrest in the tip of my fingers reminding me I no longer need to make series of key combinations to find those personal public spaces, some more arts-and-craftsy than others, because most of them are gone. These days, I just circulate through a small number of news sites, like I did when I first got online as a young girl, not yet having found my way around the Internet.</p>

<p>By now it is such a cliché to even say it, but I don’t like the monolith that we’ve become. I detest your Instagram feed, which is a highlight reel even when it isn’t. Twitter is a garbage can. To me, it was never <em>just</em> about your content, it was about your form, too. About the typographic choices you made (Lucida Grande or Tahoma), the kind of camera you used, and the frequency of your updates.</p>

<p>I suppose the bottom line is that I just feel bored about the Web. I think I may have spent so much time navigating it through social media that I’ve lost my way around the blogosphere. Which these days, ironically enough, is the name of a company specialized in influencer marketing.</p>

          <p><em>This was written as part of <a href="https://www.vineandfig.co">Vine &amp; Fig</a>’s Sunday Scripture reflection project.</em></p>

<p>When Jesus sent out his Twelve, He told them: “Whatever place does not welcome you or listen to you, leave there and shake the dust off your feet in testimony against them.” If you’re not welcomed, not listened to, quietly withdraw. Don’t make a scene. Shrug your shoulders and be on your way.</p>

<p>Last week, a friend of ours in the Vine &amp; Fig community asked me to proofread a letter. It was addressed to her parents, and it asked, in the calm voice of a young woman embracing adulthood, whether or not she and her female partner could count on the same respect, dignity, and love that she saw flow from her parents to her siblings and their partners. Our friend and her partner had just moved in together, and things had gotten serious enough that an introduction was in order, even for her huge anti-queer Catholic family.</p>

<p>The letter asked, and it did not barter.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is not the first draft,” she tells me after I compliment her vulnerability and bravery, “the first one was me basically begging to be loved.” From where I’m sitting, I can see that this isn’t the first time our friend has had to beg. Her father and mother never seemed to have <em>gotten</em> this whole queer thing. They’ve been waiting for “this phase” to end for years. In their household, there is simply no “love for the gays”. It took a conversation with our friend’s future mother-in-law to make her look at her parents with her eyes open a little wider.</p>

<p>“You don’t need your parents as much as you think you do” the woman had said.</p>

<p>I imagine our friend crawling out from under the rubble left by the type of guilt only a Catholic parent can channel. I imagine the many lives in our community, with varying degrees of urgency, transforming as we come to understand the difference between a hurt that grows from love and one that grows from neglect.</p>

<p>I imagine all of us building a home, knocking on doors to see who will help us share love the way we see it, and learning to shake the dust off our boots and moving right along, even if it requires making a whole family from scratch.</p>
