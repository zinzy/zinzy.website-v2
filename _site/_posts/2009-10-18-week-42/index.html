  <li>I can remember what was taught in my Applied Linguistics class by the shirt my professor wore.</li>
  <li>My biggest secret is an unending fascination for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momversation">Momversation</a> in which mommy bloggers discuss motherhood.</li>
  <li>Some people in my Dutch Language and Culture program are bad at spelling. All of them want to be writers.</li>
  <li>Times a day I realize I probably don’t want kids: 17.</li>
  <li>I’m terrified of failing University. During the day I’m scared, and when I’m not scared, I’m asleep. I’m a 4.5 GPA.</li>
  <li>Sometimes I miss Frédérique Huydts.</li>
  <li>Annual occasions that prompt a re-reading of <em>Bridget Jones’ Diary</em>: birthday and New Year’s.</li>
