<p>I have a friend<br />
who is so mad<br />
at the pandemic<br />
that he went on<br />
a six-day crack bender<br />
just to prove it<br />
“I’ve deleted the numbers<br />
of all my dealers
as well as the<br />
man who changed my mind”<br />
he tells me<br />
His eyes reflect a me<br />
judging him for him<br />
and I am<br />
I have deleted numbers<br />
deleted apps<br />
food<br />
versions of my<br />
self<br />
myself<br />
“Also I saw your<br />
childhood<br />
friend on an<br />
escort<br />
website<br />
She’s presenting<br />
as male again”</p>
