<p>I met Shervin at the coffee place this morning. We know each other very casually; we used to frequent the same co-working space, we’re LinkedIn friends. He has one of those faces that you just want to meet with a smile.</p>

<p>We exchange how life is treating us, what we’re doing at work. He tells me about his side projects, and how one of them is an invite-only meetup where you attend without knowing what you’ll be doing. He lets me in on secrets around the next meetup, and tells me what kind of activities are involved. It sounds magical.</p>

<p>There’s beauty in the not knowing, we agree. In the whimsy of the unexpected, the sudden connection we may feel with other humans. I tell him his project reminds me of Marina Abramović, whom Anja and I were fortunate enough to meditate with <a href="https://carre.nl/pagina/marina-in-carre" target="_blank">in Carre last year</a>. Participating in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/nyregion/04about.html" target="_blank">her famous eye-gazing practice</a> with complete strangers was transformative.</p>

<p>I’m glad I got an invitation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I got to meet one of my Internet heroes this week: <a href="patrickrhone.com" target="_blank">Patrick Rhone</a> and his family were on a Europe trip, and I was lucky enough <a href="https://www.patrickrhone.net/13189-2/" target="_blank">to catch the planning stage on his blog</a> right in time to extend an invitation. We spent a rainy Monday evening in de Jordaan at <a href="http://www.cafedetuin.nl/" target="_blank">Cafe de Tuin</a>, talking ye olde Internet productivity culture, the arts, politics, hopes and dreams, and how his teenage daughter apparently woke up one night singing “raise a glass to freedom”. Fine people, they are.</li>
  <li>After another week with Lemonade, I’m beginning to feel more confident about raising her to be a well-behaved, confident puppy. For the most part, she’s doing very well. The only real challenge we have is the barking to which she’ll resort every time she’s in the crate but not sleeping. Through trial and error, we’re slowly learning how to help her settle down more easily, and this week, the efforts have begun to pay off.</li>
  <li>I’ve got some exciting news forthcoming that isn’t quite ready for the public just yet, but it has managed to lift my spirits greatly. I’ll be able to write more in the next few weeks, but for now it’s safe to say I’m feeling hopeful, inspired, and ready.</li>
  <li>While Anja had apparently been around to watch season one when it was released, I’ve only now turned onto the wonderful journey that is <em>Abbott Elementary</em>. I would never actually ask the universe for a reboot of <em>The Office: US</em>, but this new mockumentary revolving around a poorly-managed, underfunded Philadelphia public school has exactly the vibe I would’ve hoped to get from that nonexistent reboot. It’s just nice that, with this show, Black people are at the front and center.</li>
  <li>Spring has officially begun, but as one of the regulars at my coffee place said: “the question isn’t when spring begins but when  rain ends”. It seems the weather’s getting better, though, and I can feel I’m on the cusp of storing away my winter coat. It has been a long time coming.</li>

<p>Happiness today is the ease with which the nun gives me his phone number. Paul is an old friend, or really an old friend of my ex, and we haven’t spoken in eight years.</p>

<p>I had emailed him late last year, missing our kitchen table conversations over coffee and cigarettes. His enormous house, a former school, functioning as his private art studio / gallery. He had replied right away, saying “my phone number is still the same”.</p>

<p>I had lost it long ago, of course.</p>

<p>Today, as I walk home from a coffee run, I think of him, and decide that I should make one last attempt to find his phone number before emailing him again. Looking over his message, I notice he said he no longer lived in the old school, and something about nuns. I suppose I had overlooked it the first time I read it, imagining he lived <em>near</em> a convent rather than in an actual carmelite care facility.</p>

<p>A friendly nun is happy to give me his number right away. A glimpse into a world of old, filled with kind people making generous assumptions. Two minutes later I hear his voice. “hello?”. “I’m not at all surprised you ended up living with a bunch of nuns, Paul” I glee into the phone, remembering our conversations about the Church, his Protestant, mine Catholic. There had always been something about Catholic liturgy that inspired him.</p>

<p>Despite his heavy bout of Covid, double pneumonia, and delirium, he still remembers me. Within minutes, we slide back into a conversation that never really began and never really ended.</p>

<p>Both of us are still the same to one another.</p>

<p>He gives me splinters of stories: a thieving cleaning lady, the storage and eventual donation of his body of work, the conversations he has with his neighbor priest. I tell him about Anja, about our small apartment, and about my eternal journey finding a Christian place I can call home.</p>

<p>We agree that I’ll come visit soon, and I will. A few misremembered numbers and names aside, he’s still the same old Paul. But by God, he nearly wasn’t here, and I don’t have time to waste.</p>

  <li>It snowed a few times this week and I was as baffled as I always am to see it happening in March. I don’t have a great understanding of what the weather’s supposed to do in a given period of the year.</li>
  <li>After two weeks of cocooning, we’ve finally been taking Lemonade out to various places. I aim to take her out at least once a day, usually to the park or a walk around the block. We also visited my favorite coffee place twice. It’s wonderful to see she’s such a relaxed and curious dog.</li>
  <li>This was my last full week off. I still have a few days left and then I head back into work. I don’t know how people work after they first got a puppy, and I’m grateful I was able to take this time off.</li>
  <li>I attended service at All Saints again. It was an intimate gathering with a rather inspiring reflection comparing “giving up” to “letting go” for Lent. I feel like I never get Lent right: I drop in too late, don’t see it all the way through, and this always makes me feel like I’m not a proper Christian. Regardless, it’s great to become acquainted with All Saints. Its focus on inclusivity gives me goosebumps.</li>
  <li>Lemonade met the other corgi in the building, Lalo. At only ten weeks older than she is, he towered over her as they played, but she didn’t let that bother her. He was so sweet playing with her, using his strength in a very gentle way. Here’s to hoping they’ll become best friends.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://anneliewambeek.com" target="_blank">Annelie</a> came over for tea and lemon punitions. She had been gone for a few weeks and I had missed her. She’s Lemonade’s godmother, and as they met in real life for the first time it was clear to see why this is so.</li>
  <li>Anja started her ceramics course at Studio Pansa. On Sunday she had her second class, and she took pictures. She’s such a fast learner, and the pots she made came out beautifully. I’m proud of her.</li>

<p>Lemonade, Lemonade, Lemonade. Who knew I would ever become a dog person? Two weeks ago, we picked up our corgi Lemonade Zelda Loulé. There was a torrent of research both Anja and I did to prepare for this puppy. There was a birth announcement card. A <a href="https://www.anneliewambeek.com/" target="_blank">godmother</a> was appointed. Here are some things I learned after two weeks with a dog.</p>

<h3 id="the-roi-of-good-research">The ROI of good research</h3>
<p>Anja and I are both blessed with a-type personalities and a propensity for thorough investigation. Early on in our dog prep journey, we found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@McCannDogs" target="_blank">McCann Dogs</a>, a training school with a YouTube channel full of clear, concise, and highly-informative videos on how to raise a puppy.</p>

<p>Two weeks in, I can tell they taught us well. Lemonade hasn’t had an accident in the house since day three, she sleeps through the night aside from two or three potty breaks, and it’s great to see how quickly she’s picking up commands. A week before Lemonade arrived, we started on McCann’s course <a href="https://mydogcan.mccanndogs.com/courses/puppy-essentials" target="_blank">Puppy Essentials</a>, which has proven a great way to get through the first few weeks.</p>

<h3 id="i-got-cabin-fever">I got cabin fever</h3>
<p>Out of all the things I had anticipated in preparing for this puppy, cabin fever was not one of them. While Anja and I are both quite introverted (meaning we need to recharge whenever we’ve been around people), she seemed fine spending her spring break cocooning in the house. I, on the other hand, felt myself slowly going mad over the lack of stimulus I was getting.</p>

<p>Because of our potty training schedule, and lack of a big garden, I barely got out of the house the first week. Luckily, I quickly developed the habit of taking Lemonade out on walks, even if we didn’t actually let her <em>walk</em> just yet because of her exposure to possible diseases. It’s great to be out of the house again, go to my favorite coffee spot, and walk around the park with her.</p>

<h3 id="the-beauty-of-trust">The beauty of trust</h3>
<p>Aside from an outdoor rabbit, a bird, a chameleon, and a shy cat, I never had any cuddly pets. Being child-free on top of that never gave me the opportunity to closely bond with another small being who trusts me enough that they’ll fall asleep on my body. Lemonade is very cuddly, and it’s entirely humbling to experience the trust she seems to have in me.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h3>
<p>I’m excited to enroll her in puppy training a few weeks from now. For the time being, she’s hanging out with trusted pets in the neighborhood, and getting to know many visitors. Looking ahead, I’m also pumped about finally taking her to the park and playing fetch with her.</p>

<p>She blesses Anja, me, and a handful of other people who carved out time in their Sunday evenings to come to Church. I have never been inside this particular church building before, and chuckle at how <em>new</em> the Old Catholic decor is: in imagery and candle lighting possibilities it’s reminiscent of the average Dutch Roman Catholic church. Its white walls and central heating tell me something different.</p>

<p>You may think I chose this church because the woman blessing us is Desmond Tutu’s daughter, the Reverend Canon Mpho Tutu van Furth, and because Anja and I can’t help but fangirl. I’m here because she’s a Black queer person leading a church service that I can attend in person. I never thought I would see the day.</p>

<p>Dare I wonder whether I have found a new church in <a href="https://allsaintsamsterdam.com/" target="_blank">All Saints Amsterdam</a>?</p>

<p>Living in a good neighborhood has many advantages. One of them is that it makes me want to spend a lot of time there. Saturday morning is very likely my favorite day in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>I get up, without an alarm, around 6:30, engage in some morning writing, and fanny around the house for a bit. I take a shower at 7:45, and walk to my favorite coffee place at 08:20. Sometimes I wait outside for a few minutes until their doors open at 08:30.</p>

<p>“Medium decaf mocaccino, half cow’s milk, half Tony Chocolonely.” I say it, but none of the baristas need reminding. Sometimes I bring my computer to work on my personal site, sometimes I bring a book and my diary. I’m not the only one who lives Saturday mornings like this.</p>

<p>This morning I hung out, drawing people who were conducting a similar Saturday morning routine. A great start to the weekend.</p>

<p>Walking with Annelie is coffee indoors today. We’ve told each other we need to go on more walks. She asks if we should dress warmly for the cold, wet park, or if we should just grab a table inside. Normally at this hour, Coffee Company is packed to the brim with digital nomads, so “dress for cold, hope for warmth” I say. Miraculously, there are two tables from which we can choose.</p>

<p>I’m so proud of the work Annelie has been doing, <a href="https://www.anneliewambeek.com/" target="_blank">building a business from scratch</a>, and wrapping her head around how she can do her best work. We discuss productivity; tools, methods, apps, Etsy calendar print-outs. Today, I tell her how much <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@elizabethfilips" target="_blank">Elizabeth Filips</a> has been helping me. We decide we should join <a href="https://www.meetup.com/shutupandwriteamsterdam/" target="_blank">Shut Up &amp; Write</a> sometime.</p>

<p>It was clear from the start to both Anja and I that Annelie would make a great godmother for <a href="http://lemonade.waleson.us/" target="_blank">Lemonade the puppy</a>. We’ve decided to go full over-the-top with anything dog-related, and luckily Annelie is more than happy to review my birth announcement card options. She couldn’t radiate more enthusiasm about this dog if she tried. And she hasn’t even met her yet.</p>

<p>As we shmoozed over coffee, I was reminded of the time when doing this indoors wasn’t even possible. I remember the Coffee Company line going all the way around the block, the overflowing trash bins with paper coffee cups, the increasing amount of fresh air we were all taking in. It’s nice to spend time indoors again, but I do miss the park. I can’t wait for spring to start.</p>

<p>January flew, <em>flew</em> by, I tell you. We started with “wow, 2023 already, let’s have a chill time this year, hey what’s on Netflix?” and at the time of writing everything is different:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Things are not chill, because we’re preparing ourselves, our lives, and our house for our first-ever puppy</li>
  <li>Both our work lives are unexpectedly bustling and busy</li>
  <li>We cancelled Netflix</li>

<p>I’ve been saying for years that I’d be willing to pay 100 euros a month for a single, all-encompassing international streaming platform. I suppose it’s never going to happen, but, hey, at least we’ll have that puppy, right?</p>

<h3 id="the-puppy">The puppy!</h3>
<p>Like I said, we kicked off the year very quietly, thinking “meh, someone asked us if we wanted a puppy, but we’re not really sure just yet.” This all changed ones we learned that eight healthy puppies were born and we were allowed to pick first. <a href="/2023/01/15/sneak-preview/" target="_blank">We went for a visit</a> mid-January, and fell deeply in love with little Lemonade, who’s coming home at the end of February.</p>

<p>I went from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogfree/" target="_blank">serious dog-free advocate</a> to an expecting dog parent in two months’ time, and I suppose it’s safe to say I’ve gone a bit mad. I’m designing a birth announcement card, and <a href="https://lemonade.waleson.us/" target="_blank">the puppy may or may not already have a website</a>. Help me.</p>

<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>I picked up a few great titles at the <a href="https://www.oba.nl/openingstijden/detail.199270.html/oba-oosterdok/" target="_blank">library</a> this month. One that was helpful to get through was, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/15733923" target="_blank"><em>Loose Cannons Back on Track</em></a>, about managing gifted neurodivergence in the workplace. At the moment, I’m thoroughly enjoying <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/321863.One_Continuous_Mistake" target="_blank"><em>One Continuous Mistake: Four Noble Truths for Writers</em></a> by Gail Sher.</p>

<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
<p>Musically, the year is off to a great start. I’ve made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-INeMspNSQ0" target="_blank">a new Brian Eno discovery</a> that’s hard not to love, found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMJm_97QXHA" target="_blank">Mitski gem</a> that has been on repeat, and added a great track to my work playlist: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2qsU8FGU_E" target="_blank">Tieduprightnow by Parcels</a>. As always, I’ve compiled a playlist of all of these and more. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6Xlr2LlyTQuCdgWd46KNUI?si=980c41a80e134089" target="_blank">Feel free to check it out</a>.</p>

<h3 id="watching">Watching</h3>
<p>I saw <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7322224/" target="_blank"><em>Triangle of Sadness</em></a> again this month, and loved it more than I did the first time. I appreciate how well this movie understands the finality of our social roles, and how, at the same time, they can be transformed in the blink of an eye. In addition, I am secretly a 13-year-old boy who likes to look at people drowning in their own vomit and excrement.</p>

<p>Anja and I also began watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15677150/" target="_blank"><em>Shrinking</em></a>, which is surprisingly fun. ‘Men’s liberation movement’ like <em>Ted Lasso</em>, but ever so slightly more depressing and realistic.</p>

<h3 id="something-else">Something else</h3>
<p>I find myself looking for great influencers focused on gifted neurodivergence. Like those many awesome YouTubers sharing tips and tricks on how to live with ADHD, but for giftedness, and not in some Mensa kind of way, but just something that’s honest about the challenges one may encounter. Most of what I find is written by pedagogues for parents of gifted children. If you know of anything, feel free to <a href="/hello" target="_blank">let me know</a>.</p>

<p>There’s a woman who runs a <a href="https://www.athenaeum.nl/winkels/zuidoost" target="_blank">bookshop in De Bijlmer</a>. She has kind eyes that make you want to curl up with a book and a cup of tea. Often when I’m there, she offers just that: tea, and a place to quiet down and dive into an interesting title. She’s running a fine business over there, Cole Verhoeven is.</p>

<p>Aside from bookshop owner she’s also a writer. I love the work she does at <a href="https://www.oneworld.nl/" target="_blank">One World</a>, where she articulates <a href="https://www.oneworld.nl/lezen/opinie/witte-fragiliteit-bestaat-niet/" target="_blank">strong perspectives</a> <a href="https://www.oneworld.nl/lezen/discriminatie/sociaal-onrecht/woke-ooit-een-waarschuwing-voor-racisme-nu-een-conservatief-hondenfluitje/" target="_blank">on antiracism</a> <a href="https://www.oneworld.nl/lezen/opinie/kamala-harris-is-niet-de-eerste-geschikte-zwarte-vrouw/" target="_blank">and equity</a>. A few weeks ago, she sold me this book:</p>

    </div>
</div>

<p>When I took it from the shelf, I didn’t know she was the one who wrote it. Eventually, she told me she had drawn inspiration from the questions her child asks her. The questions often leave her bemused, surprised, stunned. I suppose they’re the questions we forget to ask as we grow older.</p>

<p>It’s a perfect coffee table book, deserving of a central place in the house to welcome guests into an atmosphere of curiosity and whimsy.</p>

<p>One page that stands out to me is this one. There must have been countless times I wondered similar things as a child. Why are the garbage men brown? Why do all the other colored people live on the other side of the tracks? Why don’t I see myself on television?</p>

<p>I imagine the life of Cole’s child, growing up in this part of history, with a Black parent at home to raise him, in one of the most diverse cities in Europe. Access to a Black-owned bookshop that helps people see themselves in others. It makes me feel equal parts envy and calm.</p>

<p>My attempt to lure both Anja and myself outside for some fresh air and a walk was thwarted as soon as I learned the place was out of my favorite bubble tea. We strolled to Flevopark, in my hand an ice cream cone, and on my face the disappointment of a toddler who can’t be satisfied.</p>

<p>The park has a wide field that allows loose dogs to roam freely in the off-season. Even through the trees Anja and I spotted the corgi from half a mile away.</p>

<p>“I mean, we could just go up and chat a little, right? She might have some good tips?” Anja and I wondered, looking for an excuse to get closer to the dog. We must have looked completely adorable, because the face of Kenny’s owner brightened once she noticed us lingering nearby.</p>

<p>She told us about their routine, how he could already stay home alone for most of the day, and how she’d had never heard him bark. Within minutes we learned we all know Lalo, another corgi in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>It’s nice getting to know this new corner of the neighborhood. She and I are dog people now.</p>

<p>We had two friends over today. They’re dear to me specifically because we got to know each other intimately during our eating disorder recovery. We promised we’d one day get together and watch <em>Love Actually</em>, much-beloved by each of us.</p>

<p>I’ve developed a habit of watching this film at least once a year. Despite its soft romcomness, homogenous cast, and general lack of depth it has taught me volumes on relationships. I love it more with each viewing.</p>

<p>Today, for the first time, perhaps, I saw its fat-phobia for what it really is. It left a sour taste in my mouth; one that reminds me I’m not the audience of the film, or at least not part of the audience who should feel good after the credits begin to roll.</p>

<p>It’s annoying to see how a home cinema afternoon can make my body experience drop so significantly. I suppose if there’s any month in the year to be confronted with this, it would be International Diet Culture Month, ay?</p>

<p>On occasion, Anja will compliment me on my ability to recognize people. I don’t know when I first noticed it myself, but there are actors I recognize even if they played minor characters in an episode of a show I watched 15 years ago. Or I might point out that woman I saw on the bus before COVID hit to a confused Anja.</p>

<p>I’m learning it’s not a very common trait because of the scoffing sound I make whenever Anja confuses Keira Knightly and Daisy Ridley, or Michelle Pfeiffer and Meg Ryan. I only recently became aware how much of a jerk that makes me, and how, if we were in a room full of people, I’d stick out like a sore thumb.</p>

<p>I’ve wondered if I could be classified as a super-recognizer. I remember taking the test a few years ago and stopping halfway through, fearing that I’d see the faces of the people in my dreams and nightmares for all of eternity.</p>

          <html><body>
<p>This morning I got acquainted with the immigrant anxiety felt by Chinese-American journalist Jiayang Fan about her desire to speak accentless English. In <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/786/its-a-game-show" target="_blank">an episode of one of my favorite podcasts, <em>This American Life</em></a>, Jiayang participated in a game show designed around a talent she claims to possess: the unique ability, inspired by her anxiety, to tell at what age a Chinese-American person came to the United States. The show gave her recordings of three people to prove herself. (She got 0 out of 3.)</p>

<p>Nothing human is alien to me, and neither is Jiayang’s desire to blend in phonetically.</p>

<p>Growing up in the Dutch South, I wasn’t ever unaware of my accent, but it took me enrolling in Utrecht University to become fully aware of the effect it had on others. I could barely make it through class participation without someone chuckling in the back row of lecture hall. I decided that, on the very day I found housing in Utrecht, I would change my accent. These days, few people can tell I’m from the South. I like it that way.</p>

<p>Another thing I’ve always been afraid to sound was “black”. In the Netherlands, that usually means sounding like you were born and (partially) raised in an African country, Suriname, or the Antilles. With no such history, I’m silly to think I could ever fall into that category, which is a fine category in itself. Still, every now and then people will tell me I sound Surinamese. Unable to shake my internalized racism, I always find myself offended when they do.</p>

<p>Today’s episode reminded me of the duality of being a person of color in a conversation about speech. Like Jiayang, I find myself comparing my speech to that of other Black people, forming opinions on what I think is or isn’t “good”. At the same time, I would find it problematic if other, non-Black people were doing it for me. To me, there’s nothing inherently wrong in that distinction; it’s important people can tell their own story and not have it told for them. I’m just struck by the number of times I asked “babe, is this the example we want to give?”</p>

<p>Sometimes, when bad news arrives, I think to myself “argh, just when I was beginning to think life was nice and steady!” Today is one of those days. I’m immediately thrown off, though mostly by the scenarios playing out in my head. Not because of the particular fact of which I learn.</p>

<p>I’m disappointed by the rediscovery of life’s unsteadiness. At the same time, there’s beauty to be found. After all, there have been times in my life when I’ve been so anxious that bad news wasn’t an interruption, but a confirmation of what I already thought I knew.</p>

<p>Today, a cloud blocks the sun. I remind myself that it’s a whole lot better than rain all year round.</p>

<p>In a few days, I’ll hit my one-month mark on the piano. When I bought it and began playing, I made sure to keep an open mind about how I learn best; not following any particular method, but tailoring practices to my interests, speed, challenges, and desires.</p>

<p>One learning strategy that always works best for me is a top-down approach. With the piano, there’s great benefit in playing music from sheets (of which I’m capable), but I could tell something had been missing. This morning, as I woke early once again, this time at 03:20 a.m., I realized the missing part was an overview of which chords work in a particular key.</p>

<p>This morning over coffee at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ccjavaplein" target="_blank">my favorite spot</a>, I did some digging and found <a href="https://piano-music-theory.com/" target="_blank">Piano-Music-Theory.com</a>, which has a wonderful series on diatonic chords. If you’re not familiar, these are chords belonging to notes that make up a particular scale. Knowing the diatonic chords of each scale is going to benefit my flexibility on the piano, because I’ll be able to play songs in whichever key I need.</p>

<p>As I was drawing up a matrix of what I was learning, I remembered how special music theory really is. I love its intricacy and depth, and how it manages to capture one of life’s most extraordinary things: combinations of sounds that can tell a story.</p>

<p>More than any other time in my online life am I aware of the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text. I make a point to write image descriptions whenever I can. Kind strangers with a variety of accessibility needs have been helping me understand how to best capture my interpretation of an image. I’ve come to regard <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text as the secret side bar I get to have with blind people and others who need it.</p>

<p>For me, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text raises interesting cultural questions, particularly around its growing visibility. Traditionally, it requires that people who don’t use accessibility tools hover an image to produce what I call “the world’s slowest tooltip”. In addition, I’ve been seeing a growing number of people work <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text into places where it doesn’t exist. Places that don’t require a hover. Two examples of this are <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@zinzy" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>’s profile and banner images.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I saw the profile picture of a young woman winking. Her bio captured the image with something along the lines of “young woman looking seductively at the camera, winking, and slightly sticking out her tongue hoping to engage the viewer”. Before reading that text I felt engaged indeed, my mind painting a quick image of what her manic pixie dream girl university campus life would be like.</p>

<p>Reading her description of the image had an effect. I gather it was the overtness — her self-awareness about what the image could convey — that somehow put me off just slightly. The image and not so much her description of it but the very fact that I could even see that description, and that she understood I would, changed how I saw her in the image. It also changed how I see the Internet.</p>

<p>What does it mean, I’ve been thinking ever since, that people with no need for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text get to peek behind its curtain? What effect can this form of double meaning-making have? Does it mean we’ll eventually go on to describe images differently, knowing that not a portion of our audience but the entirety of it is looking on? Does it mean we may, some day, try to say less with imagery? In one way, I’d consider that reduction of fluff a triumph for accessibility.</p>

<p>Today, Piper Haywood’s blog <a href="https://piperhaywood.com/wais-alt-decision-tree/" target="_blank">put me onto a handy <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text decision tree</a>. I’m entirely surprised to read that the answer to the final question in the tree, “Is the image purely decorative or not intended for the user?”, is “use an empty <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code>” and not “don’t post the image”.</p>

<p>I guess that paints the best picture of how much of a reductionist I am.</p>

<p>Have you heard? Anja and I are getting a dog. It was up in the air for a little while, but we got the confirmation yesterday that we’ll get first pick of a nest of eight adorable little Pembroke - Cardigan corgi mixes. We’re meeting the puppies for the first time on Sunday. Are you crying? I’m crying.</p>

<p><a href="/2022/12/30/2022-in-review/" target="_blank">2022 showed me</a> that there are serious drawbacks to being an A type personality.

<p>In one of the many jubilant reviews garnered by Darren Aronofsky’s latest film <em>The Whale</em>, one writer concluded that we shouldn’t judge a book by its cover. This was in reference to the morbidly obese main character who eventually dies, but not before we find out he developed an eating disorder out of grief. Here was a fat man who evidently had feelings despite his exterior. Ironically, I find myself doing just what the writer suggested I don’t: judge the film before I’ve seen it.</p>

<p>As a fat person, I’m surprised to have forgotten some of the tropes society has formulated about bodies like mine. It might be the time I’ve spent recovering from an eating disorder, my underuse of popular (and harmful) social media, or my Blur It Out browser extension, but I apparently had been living in a kinder world. Everything about <em>The Whale</em> puts a damper on that experience.</p>

<p>Many may marvel at Brendan Fraser’s stellar performance, I see a minstrelsy of fatness. While undoubtedly not its primary purpose, <em>The Whale</em> reminds fat people that life is absolutely different for people who are not like us. Non-fat people can use the film to reconcile with fatness, to see the humanity behind the physical. Fat people can get reacquainted with how they’re supposed to see themselves, employing <em>The Whale</em> for scale.</p>

Here you have two high-budget oddball films that I’d describe not as mumblecore but coastercore, pulling you from one weird subnarrative into another, not really making up their minds about what they are, and before you’ve formed a full opinion on it, the ride is over, but you loved it.</p>

<p>It reminds me of the dawn of black brutalist typefaces mixed with pastel and neon gradients in web design: you look at it and your body says “wtf” and your heart goes “yes”.</p>

<p>I’ll await further data to see if I have any type of a point.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Happy Hanukkah and/or Christmas to those who celebrate!</li>
  <li>Even though our house is (reluctantly) multi-religious, we forgot just about every tradition we were ever taught for this time of the year. On Hanukkah Eve, Anja said “where are the tea lights?”, but we had no luck finding them to produce a makeshift chanukiah. Probably for the best. I don’t mind that we didn’t put up a Christmas tree, but I did find myself missing our outrageous ornaments.</li>
  <li>This week was all about the new piano I bought. I can’t stop thinking or talking about it.</li>
  <li>All I’ll say is: this piano project is the first one I’m approaching through a neurodiverse lens, and it’s making everything <em>so</em> much smoother and funner.</li>
  <li>Illegally, I’m mentioning something that happened in week 50. A. took me for my annual Fancy Birthday Dinner. For the first time since we began dating, I told her to leave it a surprise. I suppose it’s one of those benefits of having gone to in-patient eating disorder treatment: chill vibes about food surprises. If you ever have an appetite for exquisite 10-course Asian fusion dining, book a table at <a href="https://101gowrie.com/" target="_blank">101 Gowrie</a>, where the atmosphere is as beautiful as the tableware, the bread is to cry over, and the umami is so intense that you’ll have trouble putting it into words.</li>
  <li>We needed a two-nighter to finish watching <em>Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery</em>. I’m very much at that point in my mid-thirties where finishing a feature film under a warm blanket on the sofa after 8 p.m. is a challenge. I love whodunits — the genre might be in my top three — but I was quite disappointed to learn that both A. and I were able to guess the ending within the first five minutes. Janelle Monáe and Kathryn Hahn looked great nonetheless.</li>
  <li>All week, people kept asking me what I’d be doing for Christmas, and I’d cheerfully reply “Nothing! You?” every time. I feel liberated from the pressure to spend time with family or friends during the holidays, to eat more than I can carry, and to <em>be</em> and <em>have</em> fun. We certainly did have fun, just in a “really couldn’t be bothered” kind of way.</li>
  <li>I made my first batch of heavenly mud, a rich, creamy chocolate dessert. It was heavenly.</li>

  <li>I forgot how the COVID booster can make you feel as though, temporarily, the world may well be ending. I got it earlier this week, and it left me with a sore arm and that dreadful, ridiculous sensation that accompanies a flu that lasts a week too long. I mimic my late stepfather, who used to wimper like a puppy whenever he got a cold.</li>
  <li>I still do well to limit my hours of screen time. Before I know it, I’m stuck with a headache and dizzy spell.</li>
  <li>Spotify’s Discover Weekly was on point this week. Aside from lovely “beards and log cabin” tunes, as I call 70s soft rock, I’ve fallen hard for the hyper pop track <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4n0sVfRnd0UJsqcbPj7GqN?si=Z5yeyS2xTjOEWlOSI5EnmQ" target="_blank">“Notice”</a> by Moe Shop and Toriena.</li>
  <li>We raced through another season of <em>The Crown</em>, this time with the excellent Elizabeth Debicki as Diana. I love how she manages to capture Diana so well despite <em>and</em> because of her camp-adjacent interpretation of her. I wonder if she ever got a sore neck during taping.</li>
  <li>After protesting for weeks, I’ve finally let Anja turn on the heating. So far, I haven’t had much up-close experience with the energy crisis the world is currently facing, and I don’t want that to change. It’s great to feel my toes, though.</li>

<p>Recently, I’ve been making some great progress with my personal website. While I normally don’t engage in technical ballets on the goings-on of this website, I feel it’s relevant to document what I’ve learnt and done, if only for posterity.</p>

<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>: as is often the case for me, this site is built using my favorite flat-file content management system</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a>: hosts the code for this website</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a>: serves the content to my website</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">Obsidian</a>: I write in a single Obsidian vault</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git" target="_blank">obsidian-git</a>: helps me manage  the version control of my Obsidian content</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/push-git-subdirectory-as-branch" target="_blank">Push git subdirectory as branch</a>: a Github action that lets me publish a part of the content of my Obsidian vault to a separate repository</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://mtsknn.fi/blog/netlify-updating-private-git-submodule/" target="_blank">Git submodule</a>: my separate repository is pulled into my website’s code base</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://mtsknn.fi/blog/how-to-trigger-daily-netlify-builds-using-github-actions/" target="_blank">Netlify build hook</a>: every day, Netlify looks for new content and publishes it to my website</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-this-is-great">Why this is great</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I hold the strong belief that tools don’t matter. This means, among other things, that I don’t like to be limited to using particular platforms or apps to write. I want to see my files in a folder that I can move around. Jekyll allows me to do just this.</li>
  <li>My website is a text-heavy space: most of what you’ll find on here is written content. As a knowledge worker, writing is an integral part of my daily life. Many of the things I write are not for public consumption, but they are closely linked to things that <em>are</em>. To avoid duplicate content and awkward linking, it was important for me to manage my text files in a single space, one Obsidian vault.</li>
  <li>I have a tendency to tinker a lot on my website. This can make it so that I spend more time trying out new things and changing the design than I do writing. Having my code base and content separated helps me focus more on writing things that are meaningful to me.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="some-things-i-havent-figured-out-yet">Some things I haven’t figured out yet</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Is it worthwhile for me to publish more granular IndieWeb post types such as notes and likes? Do I care about them? Am I making them only to show them? What’s their value if I cannot automate this process? Does the technical implementation change if I push said content to a git repository that consists of only notes?</li>
  <li>What does a proper dark mode look like?</li>
  <li>Do I want to continue my barebones experiment and document the discomfort of vanity? Or am I ready for something more modern?</li>
  <li>How in the world do I even go about Micropub and Webmentions?</li>
</ul>

<p>The weather has officially reached a temperature that requires me to buy a new coat. I dread it. Unlike most other types of clothing, coats and jackets never seem to suit me, regardless of the style. To soften the blow of having to order several coats on the Internet hoping one will work for me, I granted myself three sets of retro socks.</p>

<p>I finished reading <em>The Midnight Library</em>, which I had borrowed from <a href="https://www.anneliewambeek.com/" target="_blank">Annelie</a>. It sure has been a long time since I last read a book that was both so entertaining and easygoing. It feels borderline young adult, and entirely unpretentious.</p>

<p>Each year I’m less embarrassed to say it: I don’t like that stretch of time during the Dutch Springtime when no work week is normal. Aside from the usual Christian holidays there’s King’s Day and Liberation Day, and I’ve found it really messes with my head. I don’t mind them much looking ahead (like I did last week, but having to live through it could well be too much for me.</p>

<p>This week, I learn that bolognese is a great base for chili, as long as you add enough cumin, beef, and beer. We watch <em>The Undoing</em>, which is a surprisingly great decision of Hugh Grant.</p>

<p>Brushing my teeth on Friday morning, I think about the weekend ahead, secretly complaining that my social engagements will keep me from getting the rest I need. Then I remember Easter Monday. The true marker of my mid-thirties is the excitement I feel at the prospect of a bed, and nothing but it.</p>

<p>I hold a baby this week, one of my favorite ones. His face has two states that exist simultaneously: the one of utter shock and surprise only newborns can have, and the one that reminds you that babies know <em>everything</em> about the world and forget it as soon as they start to speak. He laughs when I bop his nose, although I quickly learn that the force with which I bop Anja’s adult nose shan’t be applied here.</p>

<p>There’s a French bakery in Amsterdam that I visit on Wednesday with my colleague Ruby. Since their actual oven is somewhere else, I wonder if the shop even calls itself a bakery. After all, French standards would forbid it. The caramel éclair reminds me of that time at <a href="https://www.un-dimanche-a-paris.com/" target="_blank">Un Dimanche à Paris</a>, a high I’ve been chasing since mid-2018. The bread has been in the window too long. I ask if they have plastic bags, and I’m told no. I say I think that should be illegal in bakeries.</p>

<p>My childhood friend Mathilde comes for dinner on Sunday. Anja and I are giddy with excitement. In preparation, we practice our harmonies to Alanis Morissette’s “Ironic”over voice messages. Her husband asks her if she, too, heard the cat meowing. We’re celebrating her birthday, and I got her gifts at <a href="http://www.javabookshop.nl/" target="_blank">Java Bookshop</a>. When I ask them about the East-Asian gay guy who writes letters to his mom, they immediately give me Ocean Vuong’s new book of poetry. Seeing her again, I better understand what It means to have a soulmate. I sing so loud I give myself a migraine. It’s worth it.</p>

<p>It took a while before I settled into a suitable solution for the way I produce content on this website. I write Markdown, and had set up <a href="https://mdxjs.com/" target="_blank">mdx</a> in case I ever needed some more complexity in my content files. I would mostly update content through my desktop client, but have <a href="https://workingcopyapp.com/" target="_blank">Working Copy</a> for iOS installed, which I enjoy as much as anyone could enjoy a touchscreen Git client. I was missing some functionalities that are natural to the way I generally write, and so I decided to move my content into an Obsidian vault. I could make a spiel about how I love the “slow web”-ness of writing things on my phone and only publishing them when I’m on my computer, but I simply haven’t figured out how to do it any other way.</p>

<p>It has been snowing in Amsterdam. As the years go by, I’m having trouble understanding whether I’m experiencing the effects of global warming, or whether I’ve never paid attention to what was always in front of me until now. It is likely a combination of the two. Either way, it is sad to see Amsterdammers retreat into their homes after two weeks of shorts and drinks in the sun.</p>

<h3 id="at-work">At work</h3>
<p>Leeruniek’s Product team is hiring, and I’ve been the one taking care of the recruitment process for two engineering and one design role. So far, I’ve found a new front-end engineer as well as a designer within two months, so I suppose you could say I’ve been busy. If this process has been teaching me anything new, it’s that 1) I very much enjoy meeting people and learning about their (work) life stories, 2) there is such value in building strong relationships with recruiters who make you smile, and 3) it takes two weeks of introdutory chats before I begin to regret having to listen to my own voice give the same pitch over and over again.</p>

<h3 id="at-home">At home</h3>
<p>Another secret blessing of Covid has been the ability to spend more time at home, which, for me, immediately translates to the ability to better consider how I value my home environment. We’ve been churning through a pretty long list of home improvement projects, the absolute highlight so far having been installing a projector and theatre screen in the living room. Last weekend, we finished most of the work on our kitchen remodelling by putting in new counter tops.</p>

<h3 id="cooking">Cooking</h3>
<p>A while ago, we found some new recipes that we’ve enjoyed refining:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://alexandracooks.com/2016/04/25/tartines-quiche-potato-crusted/" target="_blank">Tartine’s Quiche, Potato Crusted</a> by Alexandra Stafford, which is great in itself but will be even better with a thicker crust</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://alexandracooks.com/2019/05/17/spring-fattoush-salad/" target="_blank">Spring Fattoush Salad</a>, also by Alexandra Stafford, which is quite likely the best salad I’ve ever had. I’ve had it with Namiko Hirasawa Chen’s <a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/teriyaki-salmon-recipe/" target="_blank">teriyaki salmon</a> and it is simply divine.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="watching">Watching</h3>
<p>I’ve been watching a lot of Dutch documentaries on the effects Internet culture has on children. <a href="https://www.2doc.nl/documentaires/collecties/themas/toekomst/internet.html" target="_blank">2doc</a> has a selection. I particularly enjoyed <em>My Daughter, the Vlogger</em>. I can’t imagine what it’s like to raise a child, and I can’t imagine what it would be like in 2022. Still, “all her peers will have a YouTube channel by the time they are six, she might as well get a leg up” sounds sad coming out of the mouth of a 3-year-old’s mother.</p>

<p>The tourists are back in town. Lots of Germans with face masks. I suppose we’re all beginning to venture out into the world again, just a bit closer to home. Anja and I are considering taking the ferry to Norway. Apparently you can camp virtually anywhere in that country, as long as you “leave it cleaner than you found it” and make sure you’re gone after two days. At this point, we’re vastly underestimating how attached we are to luxury. I can still hear myself whining “Bonsoihoir”. This was the catch-all name we used anyone who would come to the door of our Parisian hotel room with a bucket of ice, “no, not for champagne, just for the drinks”. I also really don’t like ticks, and I simply can’t imagine that Norway somehow doesn’t have the national health crisis taunting its neighbor.</p>

<p>We’ve begun hosting dinner parties again. <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022421-bulgogi-eggplant" target="_blank">Eggplant bulgogi</a> and <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/2020/01/roasted-squash-and-tofu-with-ginger/" target="_blank">roasted squash with soy-glazed gingery tofu</a> make for a great Asian fusion. With a side of steamed rice and homemade furikake, of course. I also seem to be making improvements with the dough I typically use to make challah and jam buns. The buns came out spectacularly well and were fluffy and delicious even without having been covered during the refrigerator proofing.</p>

<p>At work, I’m preparing for our new designer to join the team. Practically, this means cleaning up our documentation and our design system so that she has a place to land rather than a hot mess. I’m being more verbose than I normally am in my design documentation, and having to write about my decisions makes me notice all the techniques and frameworks I’ve come to use over the years. One of my favorite’s is Cohesive design, which is now so second nature that I forgot I didn’t even think of it myself.</p>

<p>On Sunday I watched a few horror films, <em>Midsommar</em> being the favorite. I also watched <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> (2022), which wasn’t even that bad until I got to the final scene. Anja and I are watching season 4 of <em>Killing Eve</em>, which I imagine and hope will be the last season. Assassin résumé aside, I get Villanelle. I get every little bit of her.</p>

<p>I never get much reading done unless I’m sleeping elsewhere. Most often, I associate sleeping elsewhere with having time off, and having time off means I’m away from a computer screen. This frees up time for reading.</p>

<p>Anja had booked a suite for my birthday at Okura, and six months after I turn 33, Covid measures are finally so mild that we actually get to do it. It’s on the sixteenth floor, overlooking the Amsterdam Centre and West Side. We eat like royalty, and fall asleep watching the sunset from our California King. I’m feeling like a million bucks.</p>

<p>Whenever we sleep elsewhere, I get overwhelmed with the endless possibilities of the things I can read. Usually, I manage to sneak five books into a suitcase, but for this weekend, I’ve limited myself to one: <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/42452986" target="_blank">Mary Magdalene Revealed</a></em>.</p>

<p>It’s a remarkable read, particularly given that the author Meggan Watterson got an MDiv and not an MFA in writing. Her words flow like a river, entirely sure of where she’s going. Every now and then, I’ll read a portion aloud to A, to share the joy of reading a theological work that is as inclusive and self-aware as it is unreserved and educational.</p>

<p>As I share snippets of insights, revelations in sweat lodges as well as things I never knew about the beauty of early Christianity, A asks me: “Don’t you find this book a bit… <em>The Da Vinci Code</em>-esque? I mean, all this talk of Mary Magdalene’s special relationship with Jesus, alternative plot lines… It’s like it’s all one big conspiracy theory, wouldn’t you say?”</p>

<p>A’s not the only woman who has made such remarks about this book. Isn’t it peculiar that feminists would rather deem femininity-inclusive gospels closer to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1400331" target="_blank">possibly the worst book in the English language that has emerged in the past decade</a> than to a perspective on Christ that could cure our heartaches?</p>

<p>I am nostalgic about the way the Web used to be. I miss the handcrafted blogs that I used to visit, and the intimate windows they gave me into the lives of strangers.</p>

<p>I miss that I knew all the domain names by heart. It is a phantom pain of sorts; an unrest in the tip of my fingers reminding me I no longer need to make series of key combinations to find those personal public spaces, some more arts-and-craftsy than others, because most of them are gone. These days, I just circulate through a small number of news sites, like I did when I first got online as a young girl, not yet having found my way around the Internet.</p>

<p>By now it is such a cliché to even say it, but I don’t like the monolith that we’ve become. I detest your Instagram feed, which is a highlight reel even when it isn’t. Twitter is a garbage can. To me, it was never <em>just</em> about your content, it was about your form, too. About the typographic choices you made (Lucida Grande or Tahoma), the kind of camera you used, and the frequency of your updates.</p>

<p>I suppose the bottom line is that I just feel bored about the Web. I think I may have spent so much time navigating it through social media that I’ve lost my way around the blogosphere. Which these days, ironically enough, is the name of a company specialized in influencer marketing.</p>

<p><em>This was written as part of <a href="https://www.vineandfig.co" target="_blank">Vine &amp; Fig</a>’s Sunday Scripture reflection project.</em></p>

<p>When Jesus sent out his Twelve, He told them: “Whatever place does not welcome you or listen to you, leave there and shake the dust off your feet in testimony against them.” If you’re not welcomed, not listened to, quietly withdraw. Don’t make a scene. Shrug your shoulders and be on your way.</p>

<p>Last week, a friend of ours in the Vine &amp; Fig community asked me to proofread a letter. It was addressed to her parents, and it asked, in the calm voice of a young woman embracing adulthood, whether or not she and her female partner could count on the same respect, dignity, and love that she saw flow from her parents to her siblings and their partners. Our friend and her partner had just moved in together, and things had gotten serious enough that an introduction was in order, even for her huge anti-queer Catholic family.</p>

<p>The letter asked, and it did not barter.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is not the first draft,” she tells me after I compliment her vulnerability and bravery, “the first one was me basically begging to be loved.” From where I’m sitting, I can see that this isn’t the first time our friend has had to beg. Her father and mother never seemed to have <em>gotten</em> this whole queer thing. They’ve been waiting for “this phase” to end for years. In their household, there is simply no “love for the gays”. It took a conversation with our friend’s future mother-in-law to make her look at her parents with her eyes open a little wider.</p>

<p>“You don’t need your parents as much as you think you do” the woman had said.</p>

<p>I imagine our friend crawling out from under the rubble left by the type of guilt only a Catholic parent can channel. I imagine the many lives in our community, with varying degrees of urgency, transforming as we come to understand the difference between a hurt that grows from love and one that grows from neglect.</p>

<p>I imagine all of us building a home, knocking on doors to see who will help us share love the way we see it, and learning to shake the dust off our boots and moving right along, even if it requires making a whole family from scratch.</p>

<p>Her Summer break started yesterday, and as always it is an event. I am so excited about getting everything right that I mostly present as a frantic killjoy. <em>Jeopardy</em> makes everything better.</p>

<p>I start today with my usual bike route past the bakeries. Niemeijer for pain au choc and canelés, followed by tiger buns and krentenbollen at <a href="https://simonmeijssen.nl/" target="_blank">Simon Meijssen</a>. Niemeijer won best croissant of Amsterdam, but I think they’re too bready.</p>

<p>In the window of Meijssen they’re showcasing pride muffins. Neither of us likes muffins, but I buy two anyway. They’re surprisingly good.</p>

<p>The other day, as I was speaking about a group of queer Black designers of which I’m a part, a White lesbian asked me: “when does a group exist just so a bunch of outcasts can commiserate about their shared otherness? I mean, could someone like <em>me</em> join?”</p>

<p>“Great questions,” I said, “my response is identical to what you would say if someone went ‘why do you need lesbian bars? You don’t see me going to a straight bar, do you?’”</p>

<p>“Fair enough” said the White lesbian.</p>

<p>I found an app called <a href="https://liberatemeditation.com/" target="_blank">Liberate</a>. It has beautiful meditations by Black and Indigenous teachers. I’ve always been a Headspace fan. Despite founder Andy’s cringey “I lived with the monks so you didn’t have to” marketing strategy, I appreciate the app for its interface and quality content. It hadn’t occured to me that the experiences I have as an Afropean could find their place in a meditation practice.</p>

<p>Part of me feels too indulgent for enjoying Liberate as much as I do. Listening to meditation teachers who have the understanding that microagressions are an actual reality in my actual life is just so different and amazing. Still, my subconscious feels sorry for the theoretical White people who would be uncomfortable if they found out I listen to Black meditations. <em>Why even bring your identity into it?!</em> Like a lesbian momentarily forgetting she’s allowed her lesbian bar.</p>

<p>The weather is great, infection rates are down, and the Dutch government loosened Covid restrictions. Masks are no longer required in public indoor spaces. I’m at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/stfyFKAKsWndZSBA6" target="_blank">Basquiat</a> waiting to catch up with a friend, and an Irish woman strikes up a conversation.</p>

<p>“I like to sit here late in the afternoon to watch the sun set between the buildings. I can’t take much sun, I have Irish skin, you know.”</p>

<p>She sneezes, and I remark how, since March 2020, “gesundheit” has been replaced by dirty looks. “I need my allergy meds” she says, in her voice a hint of embarrassment. Then she tells me about her successes of late: she and the old English Bulldog next to her have finally begun frequenting the neighborhood bars again, the ones “where everyone recognizes them”. She’s also been making lots of new friends. She suspects it’s the sign she’s been sporting on her mobility scooter, which reads <em>if I die because of Covid, it’s not your fault.</em></p>

<p>“I feel so sorry for all the young people, you know? One of them told me they were scared to go out and party, fearing their reckless behavior would kill their grandparents. You know what I told him? I told him it wasn’t his fault. And you know what? He fell into my arms crying.”</p>

<p>Apparently, she hasn’t missed a single Sunday protest on Museum Square.</p>

<p>“It’s really insane, the weaponry and violence that are on standby on Sundays. I’m from Belfast, you know, so you could say I’ve been around the block a few times. Even in Belfast, during our protests, they only pulled out weapons when things got really tough. Here, it seems that’s their only strategy. And I’m from Belfast, go figure.”</p>

<p>In the evening, Anja and I go to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/xxuU3M4o5Ew9FRMG8" target="_blank">Dignita Hoftuin</a>, where our friends Evelyn and Sander plan to announce their elopement in Kopenhagen earlier this week. Upon arrival, before I’ve been able to discern whether I’d like to consent to anything, I receive a warm hug from my friend, and a handshake from a total stranger.</p>

<p>What makes the pandemic such a fickle game is that nobody looks like they’re infected. Everyone who breaches my personal space looks kind. Still, the Delta variant is coming for us, and I’m surprised by how much my conservatism sticks out like a sore thumb everywhere I go.</p>

<p>On May 2, 2018, as we got off the plane from Stockholm, completing our visit with Anneli and Milan, I said calmly to Anja:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think I may try not drinking for a week or so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing dramatic had happened in Stockholm. We had just returned from a midweek staying with friends in the city, followed by a couple days at a cozy cabin in the woods. It was my first time meeting these friends and they are wonderful people: two kind-hearted, curious journalists and their young daughter. The father is an excellent home chef, and so we quickly bonded over soul food, shared political views, and wine.</p>

<p>Alcohol wasn’t on my mind at all. I didn’t drink more than three glasses of red during my entire stay with them. Instead, Anja and I were just… part of their warm family dynamic. Eating jubileumskaka for breakfast, reading stories before bed. I was overwhelmed by how secure I felt in their presence, so much so that I cried when we left. It was a week to remember. Looking back, I can see that it must have been this sudden sense of security, entirely unfamiliar to my person, that made me realize what I needed.</p>

<h3 id="embracing-sobriety">Embracing sobriety</h3>
<p>That one week of not drinking has yet to end (and I don’t plan for it to). Those first few months after our Stockholm trip, not drinking was embarrassingly easy. I had done it before, and Anja doesn’t really ever drink, and so our dinner parties, get-togethers, and outings were never awkward for me. I didn’t even celebrate my one year of not drinking because it just… wasn’t a thing to me. I didn’t even feel like I was sober. Not until the email.</p>

<p>I have a dear childhood friend who is as troubled a soul as I was for a long time. I’m not saying that to sound like a know-it-all, I’m just in a different place now. They have a habit of only reaching out to me when they’re doing well, and so whenever things are rough, they fall off my radar. We hadn’t spoken in a while and when they did in the late Fall of 2018, the good news was that they were entering into rehab. The bad news had been that they had fallen homeless and that they were battling a coke addiction on top of  what I had already identified as a dependency on other substances.</p>

<p>By the time Valentine’s Day of 2019 rolled around, I received an email from their sister with the invitation to write my friend an intervention letter. They would be using mine, as well as those of another friend and a few relatives to support my friend’s treatment program.</p>

<h3 id="sobriety-means-alcoholic">Sobriety means alcoholic</h3>
<p>My first draft of the letter was ready within the hour. I’ve always been at ease with writing, and so putting into words what my friend’s addiction had done to me was fairly easy. I let Anja read the letter right away. Once she finished, she looked up at me with a face full of discomfort. “What’s wrong?” I asked her. After hesitating for a few moments, she said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I hope you won’t be mad when I tell you this, but I don’t think this is entirely true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wasn’t mad. I just didn’t really understand what she was talking about. My letter was heartfelt and kind, hopeful and supporting, and I had explained to my friend how their drinking made them an untrustworthy friend, how their asking for money was awkward, and how much it hurt. Anja saw more than that.</p>

<p>Slowly, she started uncovering some truths that I hadn’t ever acknowledged, at least not to their full extent.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You know, I recall you making comments about their drinking and drug use quite often, when in reality your relationship with alcohol isn’t super healthy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had known that for some time. Heck, I hadn’t even had a drink in almost a year. Not drinking comes with a few perks, though. One of them is that you don’t have to acknowledge that your drinking is actually a problem. That day was the first day that I realized that my relationship with alcohol makes me an alcoholic. I was in such denial about that for so long that my childhood friend’s problems had come to function as a lightning rod.</p>

<h3 id="filling-in-the-blanks-i-had-forgotten-were-there">Filling in the blanks I had forgotten were there</h3>
<p>Since I’ve emotionally transitioned from being simply dry to being sober, a whole new world has opened up. I get to look at my family’s relationship with alcohol with much more clarity. I can see how alcohol was my ultimate vice in battling feelings of unworthiness, and how it oddly enough magnified those feelings. My subconscious is slowly filling in the blanks that I had forgotten were there. To me, alcohol equates forgetting, forgetting, forgetting. So much forgetting, in fact, that I didn’t even know how much I’m supposed to remember.</p>

<h3 id="what-needs-mending">What needs mending</h3>
<p>With a minimized dependency on alcohol, I have started to work on things that have been with me for decades. And I have a sobriety counter on my watch. I don’t <em>need</em> the reminder every day, but I want it. I think of <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/philip-seymour-hoffmans-last-days-77972/" target="_blank">Philip Seymour Hoffman</a> a <em>lot</em>. After successfully completing their rehab program, my childhood friend is back on drugs again, and supporting themselves with escort work. There’s a very fine line between me and that. For a long time I thought it was studying it in detail and deriving life lessons from it. Today, I celebrate 1095 days of making the right decision, and a little over two years of turning inward to see what needs mending.</p>

<p>I am on a 33-day streak picking my teeth before bed. I’ve designed a temptation bundle, pairing the activity with a few minutes of garbage television. During these days, I’ve made it through two seasons of <em>Love After Lockup</em> and six seasons of <em>Sister Wives</em>. It shouldn’t surprise you that my watching habit has extended well beyond the time it takes me to pick my teeth. Earlier this week I decided to tone it down and return the temptation bundle to its original intention. Not because I want to watch less garbage television, but because I don’t want <em>Sister Wives</em> to end.</p>

<p>I watched the trailer for <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WL3Jz8fDgFI" target="_blank">Them</a></em> and it didn’t take long for me to decide I wasn’t going to watch the series, despite how much I love Lena Waithe. People who are close to me know this already, but the classroom scene could have been taken from my life. I think I’m ready for <a href="https://audacity.substack.com/p/reality-is-horror-enough" target="_blank">Black narratives that don’t <em>just</em> center around the entertainment of collective and private trauma of Black people</a>.</p>

<p>One thing I appreciate is my growing ability to understand how small choices affect the quality of my day. I have a history of struggling with doing things that are good for me, and while I’ve always known that certain things have a more positive influence than others, I wasn’t always able to execute on them.</p>

<p>Lately, I’ve been tinkering with the way I organize my mornings. I’ve come to understand that, in order for me to have a good day, I need to incorporate, in this particular order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get up within 30 minutes of my first alarm going off</li>
  <li>Carry out a skin care routine I never thought I would be interested in</li>
  <li>Get out of the house within 30 minutes of me getting out of bed</li>
  <li>Walk for one hour</li>
  <li>Empty my Omnifocus inbox during this walk</li>
  <li>Arrive home and update YNAB</li>
  <li>Plan my day</li>

<p>The world beyond the gender binary is vast and diverse. As a queer facilitator, I’ve come to appreciate the value of writing my pronouns behind my name when it shows up in a video call or on Slack. It makes it easier for people to be good allies to those of us who have come to use pronouns they weren’t assigned at birth.</p>

<p>As a non-binary person, one of the choices I have had to make was on the topic of pronouns. Surprisingly to some, I use “she”, but really I’ll listen to anything that’s not “it”. Multiple people have asked me why this is so. After all, isn’t the whole notion of being non-binary a departure from the “she” that I was assigned at birth?</p>

<p>Yes, but also…</p>

<p>I don’t mind “she”. To me, “she” is camp. A Bette Midler song, a Wendy meme. The affection with which Meryl and Goldie address each other in <em>Death Becomes Her</em>. A woman can be a “she”, and so can a non-binary or genderqueer person, a man, or a lamp.</p>

<p>Being called “she” doesn’t hurt my reality beyond the binary. On the contrary, it amuses me. Whenever I hear someone refer to me as “she”, I giggle a little, as if someone just ran a finger across my spine. It’s cabaret to me, because that person likely doesn’t use the same defition of “she” as me. This tickling of my sensibilities brings me much more delight than deciding what pronoun works best for me. None of them do.</p>

<p>When I was a child, no physical activity brought me more delight than inline skating. I had a wonderful pair of skates; silver, neon pink, and teal, snuggly fitting my feet. I felt limitless on those wheels, cruising all around the neighborhood, learning tricks in the grocery store parking lot, and distance skating past farms and fields.</p>

<p>For the past five years, I’ve been telling myself that I should get a new pair of skates. There’s a skate store around the block from my house, and whenever I’d pass it, I’d find myself right back in the best part of my childhood. For five years, though, I never got around to actually buying them.</p>

<p>Until Covid.</p>

<p>Much like what seems everyone in Amsterdam and their grandmother, I’ve finally purchased a nice pair of skates. I got FR freeskates with three 110mm wheels as well as the protection gear I was always too cool to wear as a child. And when I say “everyone and their grandmother”, I mean enough people to keep me waiting for those skates for two weeks.</p>

<p>As a person who appreciates the (near-)instant gratification of next-day-delivery, waiting two weeks for a purchase to arrive seemed like an eternity.</p>

<p>Here’s what I did with that eternity:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Watched at least ten hours of freeskating flow videos</li>
  <li>Contemplated whether I should cancel my order and find less amazing skates that would arrive sooner</li>
  <li>Reminisce about how awesome skating felt when I was a child</li>
</ul>

<p>It was probably due to all this reminiscing that the concept of skating turned into an activity that you can’t unlearn, much like biking. My body remembered all the slides I could do, and the countless ways to stop. I figured I’d be able to take my skates out to the park within the first week or so.</p>

<p>Then they arrived.</p>

<p>Yesterday, twenty years afer I last skated, I unboxed and attempted to get into the skates. It took 30 minutes to figure out how to unlock the cuffs alone. Then it took ten minutes per skate to get the things on my feet. I’ve been awkwardly rolling around the living room ever since, grabbing onto chairs and door frames, unsure of which muscles I need to keep from falling and breaking off my front teeth.</p>

<p>I’m nowhere near old enough to complain about aging or being too old for shit, but at 33, I’m slowly embracing the concept of micro-aging. From time to time, I will meet something that confirms that my body, my mind, and my experiences have changed drastically from what they were when I was a child. From time to time, something will remind me that I’m no longer 17, and right now, skating is it.</p>

<p>I’m terrible at keeping it a secret: my favorite time in the week is when A works from home. We spent the past month building a home office in a one-bedroom apartment, and I’m happy about the result. Monday is Uni day for her. I find it endearing that her Statistics course is throwing her for a loop a little bit.</p>

<p>“Work is so great!” I think to myself on Tuesday. My onboarding period is somewhat odd because of two separate parental leaves in my team. Now that my fellow designer is back again, I have to conclude that she is an utter blast. A attempts to use her iPad as a sidecar but doesn’t get the audio right. This makes it so that I can hear all of her pupils wrestle through <em>1984</em>. When she discusses a particular rainy scene, a girl says “like, I don’t know, it’s, like, just typically English”, and we both smile.</p>

<p>After work on Wednesday, I take a bike ride on A’s super fast ebike and almost run over a young woman in Vondelpark. Running after dusk without lights should be prohibited. I bike for miles and get lost a couple times, one of the perks of living in a large city like Amsterdam I call that. I plan to go to bed early, but find myself drifting in and out as we watch the second impeachment of Trump until past midnight instead.</p>

<p>On Thursday, my <a href="/now" target="_blank">Now</a> page is published on <a href="https://nownownow.com/p/Tptv" target="_blank">nownownow.com</a>. After a beautiful day at the home office, I’m excited to play around with the Apple Watch I got in the mail when my mother calls me at 9 p.m. On speaker phone, she pours a wide variety of complaints into the room, and I tell her I don’t need her parentification<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. It’s no use expecting that she will remember what I say three months from now, so I tell her the truth.</p>

<p>I accidentally have myself a total Miracle Morning on Friday: I meditate on kindness, I take a walk in the neighborhood, and update my finances. We hate-watch the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13649692/" target="_blank"><em>Surviving Death</em></a> episodes on mediums. A tells me she’s been to more than one seance in her life. I wish there was a separate TV channel just for medium weekend retreats.</p>

<p>On Saturday, at 990 days of sobriety, I sign up for a queer-friendly AA meeting. Not drinking is easy, but I haven’t begun to connect my alcohol abuse to the rest of my life, and it makes me feel weird. I spend the better part of the day tinkering with my personal site.</p>

<p>As soon as she hands you the gift<br>
you know it’s another one<br>
“Trans Life Survivors”<br>
says the cover<br>
“Merry Christmas!”<br>
says your sister<br>
you have only been using<br>
they/them pronouns<br>
in private<br>
for a year or so<br>
it’ll look so beautiful next to<br>
the ex-gay book<br>
your other sister presented to you<br>
on your birthday last month</p>

<p>At family dinner you<br>
spend bathroom breaks in your<br>
childhood bedroom<br>
five in total<br>
logging on to talk to us<br>
about how the heavy things feel<br>
being the punching bag<br>
on which your 11-year-old cousin<br>
practises her right hook<br>
screaming fire about<br>
her trans classmate<br>
stings<br>
and<br>
it stings<br>
like a shattered jaw</p>

<p>Your father-in-law planned a<br>
Christmas pub crawl of sorts<br>
Covid-style<br>
each of the siblings hosting<br>
the entire family<br>
for a portion of the day<br>
hopping from house to house<br>
eating, drinking, loving the way only<br>
a big family will<br>
At the fourth stop you are full<br>
zonking off into the distance<br>
catching the smiling face of your<br>
sister-in-law on the way there<br>
and you remember what<br>
it felt like when<br>
she wouldn’t come to
your lesbian wedding</p>

<p>For you and them<br>
there is no Family<br>
not since you came out as non-binary<br>
and your parents<br>
yelled<br>
“check please”<br>
the only trace of<br>
those you came from<br>
is the card your grandmother sent<br>
She writes “I wanted you to<br>
know I support you”<br>
She is a sweetheart<br>
it is a teardrop in the desert<br>
that you cling to</p>

<p>Your father was no exception<br>
first the pandemic<br>
now the respirator<br>
the store has been extra busy these days<br>
but you’re getting by<br>
it’s keeping your mind off<br>
of how much he was hoping<br>
you’ll find a girl someday soon<br>
Today, the phone call<br>
from the hospital<br>
lets you know that<br>
he can come home for Christmas<br>
The disappointment you feel<br>
sits in your body like a monster</p>

<p>You have all the time in the world<br>
to tell me how you’re doing<br>
but not a moment to yourself<br>
to commit to the act<br>
with all those relatives in the house<br>
prone to restricting themselves to<br>
those parts of the Bible<br>
that make Christianity look easy<br>
and you being back<br>
in the home of your youth<br>
after the attempt<br>
confirms what you fear and<br>
what your parents have been saying<br>
is true about your life<br>
“I have no love for the gays in my heart”<br>
your father said<br>
You wonder how gay<br>
he knows you are<br>
I wonder where you’ve hidden<br>
the Pride flag that I sent you<br>
as a housewarming gift</p>

<p>Colossians 3:26 The freedom of the Lord is the wisdom to decide who is truly your sister, your brother, your father, your mother. Don’t let the bastards grind you down.</p>

            <h2><a href="/2020/11/29/of-bridges-and-neighbors/">Of bridges and neighbors</a></h2>
            <time datetime="Sunday, November 29, 2020">Sunday, November 29, 2020</time>

<p>When I first learned that ‘pontifex’, Pope Francis’ Twitter account, is Latin for ‘bridge builder’, I was entirely delighted. “How wonderful”, I thought, “that our institution sees the value in a Pope who builds bridges between the Church and the rest of humanity.”</p>

<p>When I look at myself with kind eyes, I dare to see the ways in which I myself help build these bridges. As a queer facilitator, I’m part of the leadership team at Vine &amp; Fig, a community for affirming LGBTQIA+ Catholics. When it comes to the bridge between us and the rest of the world, I focus most of my efforts on building not the bridge’s deck but its foundation. The part that contains the strong back and self love required to even begin thinking about making it to the deck, which is where all the difficult dialogues happen. You know, the ones about whether or not we’re inherently disordered and whether we should ever experience physical intimacy.</p>

<p>This image of a bridge stretching from the feet of one group to another fits in beautifully with my theology. That which is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor. That is the whole Law, the rest is commentary.</p>

<p>My fantasy of pontifical bridges stretching from one people to the next was quite short-lived. “It’s a bridge between mankind and God, babe, not Catholics and everybody else”, my partner mumbled. An anti-clerical lesbian raised on the feminism of her Jewish hippie mom, she doesn’t own a pair of rosy glasses polished by my warm memories of Christmas-time pews overflowing with chilly bodies in warm coats. The Church does not invoke tender feelings of heritage for her. Wikipedia told me she was right about where that bridge leads.</p>

<p>While our Pope is our bridge, he is also a model. He reminds us, simply by showing up, that we must strive for a connection with God; one that will help us believe the correct thing and do what is righteous, so that we will not be forgotten when the time comes. We dream, for ourselves and for our neighbors, of bridges, thick as concrete, paved smoothly with whatever pleases the Lord as well as our abstinence from sin. We have that light, and by God, we will bring salvation to the ends of the Earth.</p>

<p>Today, as we read Romans 10, which is to say Paul’s conversion strategy for the Jews and Gentiles, we get to meditate on that light, and how beautiful it is that we can share it with our neighbors. In the days of the men who wrote what we’ve come to know as the Pauline Epistles, the act of embracing Gentiles and Jews alike in the image of Christ must have been such a beautiful, tender aspiration. Today, however, their words evoke something different altogether. They remind me that those of us who don’t think the Epistle to the Romans should come with a trigger warning, simply haven’t spent enough time with actual Jews. Or really any person who has felt the foot of the Church on their own foot.</p>

<p>See, there’s a thing us Christians are primed to overlook when we engage with the world, filled with the warmth of Jesus: we are taught to long for that strong spiritual connection with The Above so fervently, that we often do it at the expense of whoever else is with us in The Below. Why do so many of our bridges lean on the backs of others?</p>

<p>Tell the Jews the Messiah has already come and how they’re missing out. Make sure you make ‘em really feel it. Take their book and forget it was ever even theirs. Don’t vaccinate. Don’t gay. Choose purity culture over an actual human’s life, choose a pastor over a child. Choose a child over a woman, choose one color over the others. Go to Africa and do things so that you feel charitable. Go anywhere but home to help your neighbor.</p>

<p>As we welcome the Season of advent — and truly, I hope it will fill our sore hearts with anticipation and longing — I want to begin reimagining the bridge between myself and God. May it be paved with whatever pleases Her as well as my abstinence from sin. May it remind me that I am allowed a seat at the table, and that this table is one to share. May my bridge be made up of all the bridges I build between myself and my neighbors, so that we may travel between this island and another.</p>

<p>Let’s meditate on us scattered sheep today, shall we? After all, if not scattered, then what are we? It has become a running gag in our household. I will be reading the New York Times, shaking my fist at whomever is responsible for the failed separation of Church and State. Or perhaps I’m mad at those who think their Christian inclination allows them to dictate what happens in other people’s bodies. My Jewish partner will do the eye roll of eye rolls and say: “funny how you all kind of <em>do that</em>, wouldn’t you agree?”</p>

<p>She’s right: we Christians have a peculiar propensity for thinking ourselves better than the rest. And I’m not talking communal, but rather individual superiority. It’s really quite basic. We all have our individual interpretation of what signifies the core and what is merely peripheral in God’s message to the people. I may very well believe that God’s love can triumph when we give queer people room to breathe (which is to say to live, love, and all that comes with it), but another equally Christian Christian may think this triumph of love requires the exact opposite response. Despite this reality, we deem ourselves the Good Follower, and the other one Not A Real Christian.</p>

<p>Hell is other people.</p>

<p>When I open my Bible to Ezekiel 34, I hear the echo of the Parable of the Lost Sheep:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesn’t he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it? And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.’ I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s something so tender and kind in both these texts; no matter who or where or how lost, we are all equally important to God. Even when we sin, through repentance we can be found again. But who is a sinner and who needs repentance?</p>

<p>To many people in the flock, the entire Vine &amp; Fig community is a sinner in need of repentance. Disguised as well-intended good Christian ministry, their anti-queer violence saturates our daily lives. And let’s be clear: when I say violence, I don’t just mean the 350 trans and gender diverse individuals who were murdered in the past twelve months. I mean your brother who didn’t come to your wedding, and your mother who keeps saying she “doesn’t believe in gender diversity”. I mean your employer who forces you to sign a document indicating that you condemn homosexuality while you try to hide your girlfriend from your Instagram timeline. I mean the godawful things your siblings parrot over Sunday supper, and your father reminding them all that he has no love in his heart for gay people.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ, it’s great that you have your flock, my man, but should we queer people even want to be a part of it?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>I’d like to think ‘yes’.</p>

<p>Because hell is other people, and during our journey towards them we encounter God. When I dive deeper into Ezekiel 34 and the Parable of the Lost Sheep, the words take on a new meaning. To me, they are not a personal consolation, reminding me that I will be found if I’m lost. They tell me, above anything, that I am part of a single enormous flock, made up of everyone, filled with people whom I think are lost, and who, in turn, believe that I’ve gone astray. The passage tells me to love God above all else, and my neighbor as myself. Even if that neighbor is keeping their foot on my foot.</p>

<p>“What might that love look like?” we all rightfully ask, immediately. In my case, love may be a ‘yes’ and it may be a ‘no’.</p>

<p>A “yes, you are right, thank you for teaching me about yourself.”</p>

<p>Or a “no, what you are saying about me and my siblings is false, destructive, and traumatizing. Here, let me help you see things through a new lens so that we can coexist.”</p>

<p>Through God, I am granted the wisdom to know the difference.</p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p>After five years of learning, falling on my face, making friends, and getting to know the travel industry, the time has come for me to say goodbye to <a href="https://airtrade.com" target="_blank">Airtrade</a>. This year, the travel industry took a huge blow, with many of the small and big clients we’ve acquired over the years in serious heavy water. What’s more, five years is a good run, wouldn’t you say?</p>

<p>If you are at all involved in queer Catholic Twitter, you know that last week was a riot. Cause célèbre was an unexpected shout-out from Pope Francis:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pope Francis told a group of parents of L.G.B.T. children yesterday that “God loves your children as they are” and “the church loves your children as they are because they are children of God.” — <a href="https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2020/09/17/pope-francis-parents-lgbt-children-god-loves-your-children-they-are" target="_blank"><em>America Magazine</em></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>My timeline was flooded, and understandably so: the Catholic Church hasn’t profiled itself as a boundary-pushing institution on very many occassions. My most vivid recollection of the Church’s stance on sexual matters is <a href="https://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091004222624/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/abuse/abuse08.htm" target="_blank">JP II blaming the child abuse horror on the gays</a>.</p>

<p>Since I became involved in queer Catholic collective <a href="https://vineandfig.co/" target="_blank">Vine &amp; Fig</a>, I have learnt something about myself and that is that I am very privileged. While many of my queer Catholic siblings fight daily battles for their identities and experiences with the people in their homes and lives, I’m only a single Pride Week removed from walking into Sunday Mass in a three-piece rainbow suit and a pink yarmulke.</p>

<p>Because of this privileged confidence, I appreciate the shout-out, but I have no need for it. I know that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>God “endorsed” LGBTQ+ people when he created us. — <a href="https://twitter.com/mattnightingale/status/1308564653547466753" target="_blank">Matt Nightingale</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Still, to most affirming queer Catholics everywhere, Pope Francis’ message was a godsend.</p>

<p>But.</p>

<p>Pope Francis certainly is not the first religious person to say that we queer individuals are children of God. Many affirming religious institutions, organizations, and individuals paved the way for him.</p>

<p>There’s something here that requires our close attention.</p>

<p>Welcoming-yet-staunchly-anti-queer congregations, Christians evangelizing ‘hate the sin, love the sinner’ rhetoric, and conversion ‘therapy’ programmes have been saying that we are loved by God for decades. Their message doesn’t ever usher in the paradigm shift we hope for. Much rather, it invites queer people to be vulnerable, and then once we are, things take a turn for the worse.</p>

<p>‘Queer people are children of God’ can be a godsend, <em>and</em> it can be a dog whistle. A poetic way of saying ‘oh it’s okay to <em>be</em> queer, it’s just very wrong to do it’, without having to take full responsibility for the origin and ramifications of your anti-queerness. After all, if your conviction is that queerness is a character flaw and not a glorious attribute inextricably connected to the soul, then technically you’re not lying. It’s a simple ‘Queer people are children of God, they just need to be saved’, if you want it to be.</p>

<p>This particular form of anti-queerness has the potential to be much more damaging than the odd ‘hey you, dyke!’ I may receive in the streets of Amsterdam. It reels us in and makes us believe we are safe. It is reminiscent of the dad in <em>Get Out</em>, who would’ve voted for Obama a third time but who also performs horror procedures on Black humans in his basement. It’s reminiscent of the friendly, middle-aged, Austrian trumpet player who has a nazi shrine for a basement in <em>Im Keller</em>.</p>

<p>‘The church loves our children as they are’ unsettles me, because I have been on the receiving end of an anti-queerness (and a racism, for that matter) that is very friendly and welcoming at face value. Its eventual uncanniness is <em>terrifying</em>. I want to know what’s in the basement. And as you know: with every good story, there’s always a basement.</p>

<p>Amsterdam’s patient zero is a woman who just happens to have spent early 2020 in the north of Italy. She has a son who attends the high school which just happens to be Anja’s place of employment. Anja is the first person I know to be infected with Covid 19. I am the second.</p>

<p>Working in travel technology, my experience of the outbreak of Covid 19 was colored by coworkers wondering by the water cooler what all the fuss was about. The most vocal among them are Rotterdammers, a people known, if anything, for its no-nonsense approach to trouble.</p>

<p>Anja and I have a different disposition. Both of us have sensitive danger antennas. They were activated on numerous occasions since late last year, with us getting increasingly more worried every time the word “Covid” was mentioned on the news.</p>

<p>Still, by early March, I was coming into the office every day, telling myself I was being too cautious. Until one day…</p>

<p>Looking back, I suppose I’m lucky to have one colleague with an immunocompromised wife. I’ll never forget the way he leaned back in his chair when I came closer to ask him a question. Rightly so, it turned out, because within a day Anja developed a cough I had never heard before in my life.</p>

<p>I know it’s difficult to imagine, but travel back with me to the beginning of this year. “We’re fine, this virus won’t reach us. And if it does, it’s not life-threatening for most of society” the government said.</p>

<p>“Could you please stop calling, ma’am? I’ve told you before it’s just a mild flu for people your age, and we won’t be able to do anything for you anyway if you come in”, my doctor’s assistant said.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until two weeks in that Anja was invited to come to a pop-up testing facility. Not the ones we have now, but a doctor’s office somewhere in Amsterdam that had been turned into a quarantine zone, people in white suits everywhere. Two weeks after that, we had an appointment at the hospital, which had built a testing facility in the parking lot. I waited outside in a tent with a heater as Anja underwent a battery of tests.</p>

<p>The man who went in before her was admitted to the ICU. I prayed rosary after rosary, wondering how in the world I’d get the car home without a license. What felt like hours was really 18 minutes when Anja walked out of the facility. Her cough was terrible, but it wasn’t long Covid. Meanwhile, my Covid was barely a sniffle.</p>

<p>For a while, I used Instagram to chronicle our experiences. I was getting hundreds of messages a day, and sharing little stories on the platform was a quicker way of updating everyone. I was just going through the archive and noticed that, at some point, the Covid-themed stories just stopped. It’s because, after six weeks or so, Anja slowly started to feel better.</p>

<p>No long Covid, no long-lasting results, a little bit of tiredness. We’re okay again. Life continues as normal, except that everything is different. The travel industry has plummeted into a deep, deep crisis. The end of the school year was bizarre, and we’re enjoying the Summer with walks in the park and watching television. Anticipating that my career might be ready for a change, I’ve been busy applying for new jobs, and I just signed a new contract.</p>

<p>Nothing is the same.</p>

<p>But at least we’re okay. People around us have been getting ill, severely ill, some of them dying. Working from home isn’t ideal, specifically because we’ve turned our little shoebox of a living room into a two-person office, but we’re getting by. We have each other, and we have <em>Ratched</em>.</p>

<p><em>This was <a href="https://vineandfig.co/blog/2020/pray-tell-clobber" target="_blank">originally published</a> as part of the Vine &amp; Fig “Pray Tell” project.</em></p>

<p>She sounds quite chipper once she makes it to the telephone. ‘Hey dear!’ it sounds. ‘Happy Mother’s Day’, I go. A few years ago, when I decided that I was going to transition into low contact mode with my mother, I couldn’t have imagined that Mother’s Day was going to be like this.</p>

<p>As many countries celebrate moms today, we remember that, on Mother’s Day last year, we saw my stepfather leave for the hospital, never to return again. The anniversary of his death is next week. Given the trajectory of my life, celebrating my mother’s parenting abilities seems ridiculous, but given the calendar, keeping a distance between us on this very day seems cruel.</p>

<p>As the daughter of my mother, I am two individuals. I am at once the person she wants to see, the one who overcame childhood troubles to arrive in adulthood a loving and supportive daughter. Also, though, I am the adult who just graduated from over two decades of therapy, someone who is active in those corners of Reddit where people go to discuss parental emotional abuse. My attachment to both of my parents is so disturbed that close contact is not really possible.</p>

<p>I remind myself vaguely of my expat friends, the gay ones who came to Amsterdam to escape their queerphobic countries. When they talk on the phone with their parents, they have to ignore so many parts of their personality that they become other people. They don’t really have a choice.</p>

<p>And I do, at least, this much I’m told by the Catechism of the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>After all, a good Catholic is someone who honors their father and mother. Sometimes, after working myself into a frenzy thinking about this, I research Catholic teachings on the healthy and God-loving child-parent relationship. My clobber passages are not the ones about queerness. They are those verses that tell me that children who don’t provide for their parents are worse than unbelievers. That it pleases the Lord when I obey my mother in everything. I don’t experience any spiritual rewards of peace and prosperity when I honor my parents the way the Bible (or society) teaches me. I experience the opposite.</p>

<p>‘Jews have the same teachings, you know’ my favorite person will say. ‘Really?!’ ‘Yes, you… stole our book, remember?’ it will follow, jokingly but only because there’s truth in most jokes. Two things are true, she says. ‘One: biological parents aren’t the only ones doing the parenting. Take Grandma Dora, for example. You always tell me how safe and welcome you felt in her home. Now that is a parent.’ ‘And two?’, I’ll ask, hopeful. ‘Two: it’s up to you to decide what constitutes honoring your parents. Either you can decide, or you can be miserable.’</p>

<p>I’m trying.</p>

<p>Our friends gave birth to their first child, Eleanor! She was born on a trip east, and had to spend some time at the hospital. They sent us a wonderful photograph of her reaching out from her hospital crib. I simply <em>had</em> to commemorate.</p>

<p>Proudly nasty, I joined Anja, my mother-in-law Sauci, and millions of others around the world last Saturday to attend the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Women%27s_March" target="_blank">Women’s March</a>. Museum Square in Amsterdam was full of pussy hats, face paint, smiling faces, and righteous indignation.</p>

<p>I don’t often attend protests, not in the last place because I’m cautious about negative media outlets that often ridicule protesters, but I loved being a part of this day. I have no idea what’s in store with this American presidency, but I imagine it can’t be very positive. I feel fortunate to live in a place that lends itself well to such protests. It makes me feel less scared and less alone.</p>

<p>What a time to be alive.</p>

<p>“Slept a little, had a midnight snack, went in for a bathroom break. Slept some more. Basically the life of a four-year-old” she says, and she tells me about her flight to Stockholm. She has been sleeping poorly lately; I say “lately” but I only met her last month, so I don’t know what her sleep hygiene is, although she says “it has improved since I began falling asleep in your arms”. I imagine how she sleeps on the plane, entertaining the other passengers, cabin crew, and pilots with her stupefyingly loud snores.</p>

  <p>I’ve heard someone compare it to the relationship between a parent and a child. I imagine a child wanting to create a birthday card for his mother, opting to draw her portrait on the cover. Does that child draw a lifelike portrait of his mother? No, but it sure is endearing. I just want to draw the most beautiful portrait I can with the colors I got from my Mother.</p>

<p>Christmas break is passing by me like it passes by an ambitious teenager. I greeted all the things I could do with great enthusiasm. Sadly, that feeling quickly turned into terror once I realised two weeks isn’t that long and I need to sleep.</p>

<p>Productivity-wise, man can only fail under such conditions, this I know.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I keep being amazed by the weather in Haarlem. I managed to take some photos downtown last week that remind me of the beginning of September, despite a winter coat here and rain hat there.</p>

<p>The only journal I’ve ever been able to successfully keep is a photo journal. Not so much the one-book or one-website type, but more so a simply collection of visual anecdotes, encounters and experiences. My first website was called www.doyoulikemytightsweater.com. It was a HTML-based one-photo-per-page website that I updated very frequently. Ever since the domain expired and I got a little sick of getting pervy emails (I should have known), I had never owned a photo website that I loved so much.</p>

<p>The problem with my offline photo journalling habit was that I could never enjoy looking at my photos. There were no visuals to support my Finder, and I loved seeing them come together when arranged in a certain way. So, for approximately five years I didn’t really look at any of the photographs I took.</p>

<p>Today, a tiny new chapter opens up with the birth of a new website dedicated to these photographs. I’m in the process of selecting the ones I love most from 2005-now, and publishing them in a horizontal fashion. They’re relatively small, always have to be seen in relation to each other, and are created by a collection of cameras. They were taken for a number of reasons; many for clients, but even more for my personal gratification.</p>

<p>As of now the website is located at <a href="http://zinzygeene.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>, but that will most likely change to a more personalized address. I’m contemplating using <em>zinzygeene.nl</em>, which I think is always a joke when it comes to a serious portfolio website, or another one I have registered. Stay tuned.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I’ve taken it down because I can’t get over Tumblr’s problem with ownership.</p>

<p>Yesterday, as I swiped through my digital September issue of Wired, I came across a bit that immediately swung me back right into my first year of high school. Presented on the page where a Nokia 3310, a 56k modem, a Dot-matrix printer, a Tube TV, and a Speak &amp; Spell. It was a piece about the Museum of Endangered Sounds, a digital archive of sounds we all remember so, so well.</p>

<p>Super geek Brendan Chilcutt (the nom de plume used by the collective who founded the museum), fearfully wonders:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>when the entire world has adopted devices with sleek, silent touch interfaces, where will we turn for the sound of fingers striking QWERTY keypads? Tell me that. And tell me: Who will play my GameBoy when I’m gone?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve been playing with the website multiple times during the day, and I hope it’ll stay live for a long time to come. The quality of the sounds is impeccable, and it really gets you back into that mood of being relaxed, or slightly terrified about something as cute as a pop quiz, or a boyfriend who wouldn’t call, or not having that cool phone with a personalized cover. I  I had a box I could fill, keep in the closet and open up whenever things were getting gloomy and I wanted to be close to Grandma Dora, here’s what sounds I’d put inside it:</p>

<h3 id="the-rotary-dial-telephone">The rotary dial telephone</h3>
<p>It reminds me off the phone my old friend Leonne gave me. It used to belong to her grandmother, but she wanted me to have it. I placed it in my room and felt incredibly proud, because I was the only one I knew who owned such a beautifully old device. What I enjoy remembering is the fact that I hardly ever got a single caller asking for me, because I didn’t have my own landline. I spent many hours eavesdropping on my Mom and her friends having boring conversations about nothing important.</p>

<h3 id="the-floppy-disk">The floppy disk</h3>
<p>I remember the time in December of 1999 when Pokémon Red and Blue had just come out. Every kid in my school wanted the games, and most of them wanted a Game Boy so they could play them. I already had a Game Boy, I had been addicted to Tetris and Super Mario Land for years. But my mother refused to get me the games. Luckily, my cousin’s cousin Ben, a notorious local nerd, had managed to get me two floppy editions for free. I didn’t take the disks out very often (I was always playing the games), but I clearly remember that very first time I ever heard a floppy disk up close, when I put in Pokémon Red.</p>

<h3 id="tetris">Tetris</h3>
<p>Sitting in the attic, or under my bed, playing the game until my thumbs got sore and I actually had repetitive strain injury. And to this day, if I can get my hands on the game (I’ve refused to download the iPad version), I will not say a word for hours.</p>

<h3 id="the-tamagotchi">The Tamagotchi</h3>
<p>This is a sour one for me. Because, while I loved my Tamagotchi in the beginning, I ended up hating its guts. In the late nineties, every single kid in my school had one. I loved taking care of something, the cute sounds it produced and the flashy colour of the case. We were inseperable. But then came 1998, and with it the motherfucking Furby.</p>

<p>Furby was brought on the market right before Christmas (cheeky bastards), and some of my richer friends (five of the six girls in my group, I was the other one) had a Furby. So, my Tamagotchi and I remained friends as the other girls hung out at the park with their furbies, having tea parties in pink sweaters and SHUT UP. I don’t care.</p>

<p>My friend Paul is a very wise man. Last week, as he drove O. and me home after a morning of catching up at the house / workshop / gallery / former school building in which he dwells, he said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would love to have another life, 
just so I could spend it cursing
at everything, and everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The negative character of this man is self-evident. He’s as much a misanthrope as he is an engaging full of life and stories. It makes hanging out with him a free afternoon at a comedy club. His lifestyle is perfectly suited for his disposition. I’m positive his house contains more rooms than even he can count. There is a room for his art, another one for the art his students produce, various studios, six bathrooms, and three separate kitchens. He lives alone where he is boss.</p>

<p>Paul is also much older than I am, think a young grandfather. I expect that his age plays a large part in how comfortable he is low-key hating everybody. I’m not so lucky. Whenever I find myself muttering that “I hate people”, my self-talk quickly turns to shame and guilt. What if mankind is, in fact, nice, and I just happen to not see it? What if all those people on trains producing noises that make me want to explode would happily carry on a conversation with me, if only I was open to some fun?</p>

<p>Sometimes I think it would be incredible to have a door in my house, one that only I have the key to. It opens to a world exactly like this, except that nobody there can hear me scream and curse. I would hang out there on occasion, using profanity so profane that Satan would eventually have to come in to please ask me to simmer down because I was offending all the racist, nazi pedophiles in the hottest, darkest corners of hell.</p>

<p>It isn’t so much that I am mad at anyone specific, but more so the earth as a whole with everything and everyone on it, including myself. Or maybe I’m not even mad, but rather afraid? I mean, that’s where anger sometimes comes from, right? Maybe if I take a pillow and shout into it really loudly, and then go back to doing whatever, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120114230620/http://itllbebetter.com/" target="_blank">it’ll be better</a>, and I’ll be able to get on with my day, working steadily towards artistic retirement in which I smoke excessively at my kitchen table like Paul, worrying about how many lives I need for all my expletives.</p>

<p>It was indeed great while it lasted, until about three weeks ago. Churning out little posts, coming up with fun tidbits, roaming the streets of Eindhoven with a little noteback. Getting feedback. Compliments. Your mother’s cousins’ daughters’ coworkers are reading your blog. And then university life begins. And there is time for nothing.</p>

<p>So here’s a change of strategy, and of pace.</p>

<p>This website will be featuring different forms of content from now on. No more updates on my general well-being, college achievements, and peculiar trains of thought. Sure, there’s enough happening, but the focus isn’t where it should be: on a white piece of paper. Instead of feeling shame about my lack of commitment, I will simply change the contents.</p>

<p>If I were you, I would adjust my expectations for this particular website: pictures without explanations, cryptic musings, things I like, things I wish to remember, and sometimes the old blog post. Or a combination of all of the above, or something entirely different. You have been warned.</p>

<p>Sorry.
Love you too.</p>

<p>I remember it well, my transition from elementary to high school. Gone were the old days of person teaching every subject in a single classroom. Everything would be new again. New subjects, new people, teachers, supplies. It was the supplies that kept me up at night. Books were to be given the right cover, of course there would have to be a new pencil case. New notebooks. A diary.</p>

<p>Choosing was never my strong suit. I could stand there for hours, by the neatly arranged tables of school supplies. After all, they would have to last me the entire school year. The right supplies, this I figured, would lead to the right achievements. I was so young back then.</p>

<p>Year after year I’d find myself biking to town in the Summer months. Cover paper, new pencils, a nice fountain pen, snazzy fineliners. Preferably all the things.</p>

<p>Today, I went to shop for new supplies. I’ll be starting my freshman year of university, after a one-year hiatus. I hadn’t made a list, I figured a veteran like me could do without it on a trip like this. As soon as I’d get to the store, all the requirements would come to me.</p>

<p>The one thing I was keen on finding was a four-subject notebook, one for each course. And after that? Well, that was about it. I did already have a pencil case. And a fountain pen. And pencils. And binders. And a backpack. And a diary.</p>

<p>Home I went, with a teeny tiny plastic bag and two A5 notebooks.</p>

<p>After nine years, I realize I have everything I need. I no longer believe I need certain things to achieve my goals. Now it’s just a matter of doing the work, with everything I need just within reach.</p>

<p>It’s Gay Pride today. Yesterday, as N and I were on our way to the cinema, somebody yelled “DYKES!” at us.</p>

<p>I dislike such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia" target="_blank">antics</a> as much as the next gay. I don’t like the words “dyke” and “fag” and the stigma surrounding homosexuality. Since we’re alive in the modern world of 2009, I always fervently hope that people know better by now.</p>

<p>I’m lucky enough to live in an environment with friends and family who support me. My choice to walk hand in hand with N, and not Nicholas. I rarely encounter homophobia.</p>

<p>But then again, I don’t look like a lesbian. It’s a personal choice: I’m also Dutch, half African, an inhabitant of Eindhoven, married to reading, writing, and books, and in love with Anohni<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> from that band. If I were to express all of those identities, I might as well start wishing I turn into a float tomorrow.</p>

<p>What I’m annoyed with is the fact that yesterday, I saw 300 different stereotyped people pass me in the street, and I somehow managed to keep my mouth shut to all of them. Because I <em>do</em> care about other people’s feelings. Because we live IN THE NETHERLANDS, damnit.</p>

<p>But you know, I think about things, and I know the insecure, angry, Moroccan teenager is not to blame. After all, I’m sure he’s had a few insults hurled at him, and he was just reciprocating this civil friendliness. This experience reminds me I don’t live in a country that fully accepts the life I live. Whichever way you look at it, emancipation in the gay scene isn’t as omnipresent as we think it is.</p>

<p>Because today is the Day of Days, and some people are on their tenth sangria dancing on a boat in thong underwear, I think it’s only fitting to think about what a multicultural and diverse country such as the Netherlands is really doing.</p>

<p>Are gay people more emancipated than the San Francisco of the 70s? Or do the near-naked protests, gay gyms, gay saunas, gay stores, gay parties, gay travel agencies find ways to work against us? Is the gap between straight people and gay people bigger than we care to admit? Are we still asking whether “we” fit into “your” world and vice versa, or is there finally space to start talking about “our” world?</p>

<p>If “we” want to fit into “your” world — which I think we’ve already been doing for decades, just to the inattentiveness of some — is it smart of gay people to seclude ourselves to spaces designed for people like us? When one lesbian says “hey dyke” to another, it’s a term of endearment. But if a straight girl or, even better, a Moroccan boy, says the term casually near a gay person, we call it discrimination.</p>

<p>I’m for emancipation, and against exception.</p>

<p>That’s why I’m sitting here writing this instead of celebrating Gay Pride.</p>

<p>What do you think? I know it’s a difficult subject, but please keep it civil in the comments. Constructive criticism, please.</p>
