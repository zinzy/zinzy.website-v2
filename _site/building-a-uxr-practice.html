<h3 id="its-perfectly-possible-for-a-company-to-have-all-the-necessary-people-knowledge-and-skills-in-house-and-still-drop-the-ball-on-user-research">It’s perfectly possible for a company to have all the necessary people, knowledge, and skills in-house, and still drop the ball on user research.</h3>
<p>That’s not a dig, it’s a practicality.</p>

<p>When I joined edtech scale-up Leeruniek, one thing was very clear to me: everybody here wants to make Dutch education more equitable and effective. From its infancy, the company had vocalized an interest in design, hiring an interaction designer to lead the way. Through rapid iterations, propelled by live user feedback gathered on Pizza Friday, Leeruniek had quickly gotten the lay of the land they were hoping to conquer.</p>

<p>As with any start-up, though, growth hurts.</p>

<p>During my onboarding, I found a siloed designer with an InVision account full of ignored ideas, and a product team that sporadically carried out research by calling users. I found a product manager who struggled to articulate the ROI of user research, and <mark>countless opportunities for user research that weren't being leveraged</mark>.</p>

<h4 id="proper">Proper</h4>
<p>This didn’t mean we wore lab coats, rather it laid the foundation for honest, scrupulous, transparent, independent, and responsible research, conducted to inform us on the real, complex worlds of our users.</p>

<h4 id="accessible">Accessible</h4>
<p>We wanted everyone in the company to learn from what we learned, and to use it to their advantage. This meant foregoing UX jargon, and remembering that everyone in the company would use our insights.</p>

<h4 id="atomic">Atomic</h4>
<p>Breaking research down into its building blocks, we discarded the framework of the research report. This enabled us to turn research into insights while retaining the possibility to quickly find and use these insights in the future.</p>

<h4 id="continuous">Continuous</h4>
<p>B2B end users are busy, and it was no different for the educators we serve. Rather than building waterfall research projects around our priorities, we let our users’ full calendars lead the way in planning and conducting efficient mixed-method research.</p>

<p>There had been multiple attempts in the past to roll out a company-wide tool that measured customer health, but they never made it beyond a Google doc. Together with data specialists and educators, I crafted <mark>a simple tool that was the beginning of something, rather than its completion</mark>.</p>

</div>

<h4 id="finding-common-ground-among-uxers">Finding common ground among UXers</h4>
<p>The designers in our team all had experience with research, but our approaches varied widely. I helped us get on the same page by facilitating a workshop in which we asked each other the important questions: why do we do research, what do we hope to learn with a particular method, and what musn’t we forget in preparing for it?</p>

<div class="hero">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbi2zounq/image/upload/v1677058448/Portfolio/Building%20a%20UXR%20practice/uxr-method-workshop_lthd0z.png" alt=""> 
</div>

<h4 id="re-establishing-methods">Re-establishing methods</h4>
<p>Thanks to our workshop, I could see that the ideas we had about research methods aligned quite nicely with Nielsen Norman Group’s famed <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/which-ux-research-methods/" target="_blank">Landscape of User Research Methods</a>, which became a staple image in the research repository we would be building next.</p>

</div>

<h4 id="teaching-consultants-how-to-uxr">Teaching consultants how to UXR</h4>
<p>With our educational consultants at the heart of all the action, we devised tools that helped them complement our research. By <mark>stripping the jargon from best practices</mark>, the other designers and I consistently coached consultants on uncovering research nuggets.</p>

<div class="hero">

</div>

<h4 id="product-metrics-for-more-than-just-product-research">Product metrics for more than just product research</h4>
<p>Listening closely to the needs of other departments in the company, the product team evaluated different product analytics tools, settling on Mixpanel for its segmentation, analysis, and collaborative capabilities. We set it up to track product usage for our own benefit, and found ways to make it useful for our consultants, sales staff, marketeers, and customer service colleagues as well.</p>

</div>

<h4 id="recruiting-the-right-participants">Recruiting the right participants</h4>
<p>One of my favorite things about specializing in enterprise SaaS is that users are often so close by. Integrating design email traffic into our company’s CRM system helped us read along with conversations our consultants were having, finding many research participants in the process. We also began integrating analytics into our Customer Service tickets, following up the antipatterns we were uncovering into meaningful research.</p>

<h3 id="building-a-cost-effective-flexible-ux-research-repository-in-notion">Building a cost-effective, flexible UX research repository in Notion</h3>

<p>I love to remind myself that tools don’t matter. I try to avoid vendor lock-in, and will choose a plain text editor over the newest writing tool if it means I can read what I wrote fifteen years from now. I took the same approach with this project.</p>

<p>UX research tools are a hot topic right now, and it shows in their subscription models. I didn’t want to spend hundreds of euros each month on a single research tool, and coupled with our hope for tool-agnostic knowledge-building we landed on Notion.</p>

<div class="hero">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbi2zounq/image/upload/v1677058447/Portfolio/Building%20a%20UXR%20practice/uxr-notion-principles_szeelf.png" class="border" alt="">

</div>

<h4 id="prompting-research-with-templating">Prompting research with templating</h4>
<p>Our conversations about research methods had helped the design team get ready to craft session templates we all loved to use.</p>

<div class="hero">

</div>

<h4 id="connecting-everything-and-everyone">Connecting everything and everyone</h4>
<p>The beauty of Notion is its ability to create connections between virtually any two things. This made it easy for us to track whether users of the same profile had requested the same feature, or whether a particular school was extra vocal about a challenge across all year grades.</p>

<div class="hero">
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbi2zounq/image/upload/v1677058446/Portfolio/Building%20a%20UXR%20practice/uxr-notion-findings_qkssvy.png" class="border" alt="">

<h6 id="what-changed">What changed</h6>
<h3 id="we-reduced-our-cycle-time-and-found-friendships-along-the-way">We reduced our cycle time and found friendships along the way</h3>
<p>Our work had turned UX research into an accessible service. We’d given ourselves tools to strategically embed research into any project, which eliminated research for the sake of research. In the product team, this enabled <mark>more efficient design iterations, informed just enough to keep us going</mark>. Outside of the product team, this meant closer, more mutually-understanding bonds with colleagues in every corner of our company.</p>

<h4 id="designers-as-research-coaches">Designers as research coaches</h4>
<p>This project helped the designers better understand how to explain research and design principles without sounding like pedantic know-it-alls. We came to understand how to connect with different types of coworkers and shared our knowledge whenever we got the opportunity using simple research artefacts to guide the conversations.</p>

<p>Stakeholder management is always a delicate play of expectations and assumptions, and it was no different at Leeruniek. Even though the company is an educational technology startup, most of the people there had never worked with product people, developers, designers, or researchers before they joined.</p>

<p>Who knows more about educational users? Consultants who used to be teachers, or the people trained in empathizing with teachers? This project helped me break down walls, make Dunning-Kruger a topic of friendly conversation, and encourage designers to say “respectfully, you’re wrong” whenever necessary.</p>

<h6 id="whats-next">What’s next</h6>
<h3 id="a-dot-on-the-horizon">A dot on the horizon</h3>
<p>I like to make tools that enable conversations and propel meaningful work. It’s no different with this project. The designers and I continuously work to improve our skills, and to expand how we use research in the company. In addition, we’re currently working to align more closely with consultants who work with school boards, exploring opportunities for deeper research, and a better design process for their consulting reports.</p>
