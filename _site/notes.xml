<p>Hey Ornella, as promised a small introduction into the world of personal knowledge management (PKM):</p>

<ul>
  <li>PKM helps us collect, classify, save, search, find, and share information</li>
  <li>By taking atomic notes and densely linking them we can come to new ideas</li>
  <li>There are many PKM tools available, each very advanced and functionality-rich in their own way</li>
  <li>The easiest, and cheapest, way to get started with PKM is by downloading Obsidian</li>
  <li>You may want to download their <a href="https://obsidian.md/download" target="_blank">Windows</a> app</li>
  <li>If you use a cloud service like Dropbox, you can easily back up your notes</li>
  <li>I think you may enjoy <a href="https://writingcooperative.com/note-taking-is-not-enough-knowledge-management-for-researchers-and-writers-319acec1fc2e" target="_blank">this article on PKM for researchers</a>
</li>
</ul>

          <p>It feels cliché to phrase it like this, but I feel I witnessed a historic Keti Koti ceremony today, with a surprisingly genuine request for forgiveness by our king. It was a good year for me to finally understand my place in a holiday that’s part mine and part not. The ceremony made up for the hour-long wait in the half rain to get a sandwich for someone who had already gone home. Wan swit’ manspasi!</p>

<p>How to care for the injured body,</p>

<p>the kind of body that can’t hold
the content it is living?</p>

<p>And where is the safest place when that place
must be someplace other than in the body?”</p>

          <p>Hey <a href="https://elliott.computer/">Elliott</a>, so lovely to have you over for coworking this afternoon! I love the way you think about UX; your artistic perspective is so valuable for the Internet and for web design, and you always make me see things from a new angle. Aside from the links I already shared with John and Maarten on <a href="/2023-06-23-14-00-00">June 23rd</a>, here’s some stuff I love:</p>

<p>Hey <a href="https://elliott.computer/" target="_blank">Elliott</a>, so lovely to have you over for coworking this afternoon! I love the way you think about UX; your artistic perspective is so valuable for the Internet and for web design, and you always make me see things from a new angle. Aside from the links I already shared with John and Maarten on <a href="/2023-06-23-14-00-00" target="_blank">June 23rd</a>, here’s some stuff I love:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://jason.cosper.me/" target="_blank">Jason Cosper</a> inspired me to get rid of my About page.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">Agile</a> and <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum" target="_blank">Scrum</a> are quite complex, and multi-interpretable, but <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/lean-ux-agile-study-guide/" target="_blank">Nielsen Norman Group</a> has a few nice resources.</li>
  <li>When it comes to extraversion and “people-person”-ness, I think the UX industry is quite a good fit for those who aren’t those things. Like I said, your ability to create an icebreaker on the fly isn’t half as interesting as your ability to figure out what UX method can answer a specific question. This reminds me of <a href="https://vimeo.com/719000396/65193d4f26" target="_blank">a talk I attended at UXInsights Festival 2022</a>, which wasn’t about this topic per se, but about making UX research accessible for neurodivergent UX professionals. You might like it!</li>
</ul>

          <p>Hey <a href="https://www.jboy.space/">John</a> and <a href="https://murb.nl/">Maarten</a>, thanks for meeting me for coffee! I loved nerding out with you two about IndieWeb stuff, personal sites, the red ThinkPad belly button, and what personal web projects we’re working on.

I loved nerding out with you two about IndieWeb stuff, personal sites, the red ThinkPad belly button, and what personal web projects we’re working on. As promised, here’s a list of things I wanted to share with you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A few IndieWeb people I like (who are involved in the community in various degrees) are <a href="https://simonesilvestroni.com/" target="_blank">Simone Silverstroni</a>, <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/" target="_blank">Manuel Moreale</a>, <a href="https://muan.co/" target="_blank">Mu-An Chiou</a>, <a href="https://derekkedziora.com/" target="_blank">Derek Kedziora</a>, and <a href="https://elliott.computer/" target="_blank">Elliott Cost</a>, the latter two of whom live in Amsterdam as well.</li>
  <li>The friendly PhD candidate we met is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ornella-porcu-5aa20119" target="_blank">Ornella Porcu</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll spend some time in the next few weeks cleaning up my site. I’ll probably also try to establish some form of digital garden again.</p>

          <p>Reading a book on Bijlmer Bajes (a famous Amsterdam prison), and I’m chuckling at the architect’s decision not to add bars to the windows, but instead rely on “wire alarm” in the glass. Obviously it resulted in a lot of prison breaks, but what fascinates me is that the user story changed completely from a prison guard aiming to keep a prisoner from breaking out to them aiming to be alerted to a breakout attempt.</p>

          <p>One skill I’m pleased to have been cultivating these past few years is giving myself a permission slip to rest. I just woke up from a two-hour nap and boy, the world is a new place. Anja clearly remembers the dragon I would turn into whenever I was in need of a nap or just waking up from one. As though I would need to punish myself for having taking a break. Now, it’s a mere drop in an ocean of post-nap ecstasy for me.</p>

<p>Playing the piano is helping me put some puzzle pieces in the right place. I’ve always had the ability to reproduce the  pitch of a song, but it wasn’t until I began playing the piano that I now seem able to identify the key by name. It may seem silly or small, but that’s a game-changer for me. It makes me feel that I can put everything together now; as though I’ve come full circle.</p>

          <p>I love this essay, Simone. Fully embracing the very IndieWeb concept of a personal website has helped me shake this feeling of FOMO, I imagine the same way it did for you. Don’t be hard on yourself, though, we all fell for this concept, and many of us still do. If society presents something as a way to solve a problem, most people will eventually try it. And while it does solve <em>some</em> problems, it also creates others. I have a few Gen Z friends who never fail to make me feel old whenever they talk about “their personal brand” in an unironic way. Gives me the shivers.</p>

<p>Darn Barry, I feel like 2023 is throwing you for quite a loop. Ever since you wrote about you getting laid off I think about you every now and then. I’m sorry this happened last week, although I must say I suppose it’s a lucky thing those divvies wanted to get a break-in early bird special.</p>

<p>If you still needed convincing that I’m Grandma Tech at home, struggling to use even the most straightforward of functionalities, please be aware that I was today years old when I learned that, five years ago, <a href="https://textexpander.com/blog/textexpander-tip-try-our-ios-keyboard-and-one-tap-text-snippet-keys" target="_blank">TextExpander released a custom iOS keyboard</a> that would’ve solved so many of my mundane problems, and all I was doing was asking myself “why am I even paying for that app anymore?”</p>

<p>Listening to act two of <em>This American Life</em>’s episode <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/789/the-runaround/act-two-6" target="_blank">The Runaround</a>, in which we meet a boy who can only really calm his mind by running loops around the block, I can’t help but wonder: it’s beautiful to see a young problem-solver with ADHD make life easier for himself, but were there other people who thought of the compensatory behaviors often displayed by people with an eating disorder?</p>
