          <p>I was pleased to find out just now that the longest distance between two things on Earth ever photographed is a whopping 443 km. Photographer Mark Bret was in the Pyrenees when he was able to photograph the Alps. (Via <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@marnanel@queer.party/109968333660321913">Marnanel</a>)</p>

          <p>I love this essay, Simone. Fully embracing the very IndieWeb concept of a personal website has helped me shake this feeling of FOMO, I imagine the same way it did for you. Don’t be hard on yourself, though, we all fell for this concept, and many of us still do. If society presents something as a way to solve a problem, most people will eventually try it. And while it does solve <em>some</em> problems, it also creates others. I have a few Gen Z friends who never fail to make me feel old whenever they talk about “their personal brand” in an unironic way. Gives me the shivers.</p>

<p>Darn Barry, I feel like 2023 is throwing you for quite a loop. Ever since you wrote about you getting laid off I think about you every now and then. I’m sorry this happened last week, although I must say I suppose it’s a lucky thing those divvies wanted to get a break-in early bird special.</p>

<p>If you still needed convincing that I’m Grandma Tech at home, struggling to use even the most straightforward of functionalities, please be aware that I was today years old when I learned that, five years ago, <a href="https://textexpander.com/blog/textexpander-tip-try-our-ios-keyboard-and-one-tap-text-snippet-keys" target="_blank">TextExpander released a custom iOS keyboard</a> that would’ve solved so many of my mundane problems, and all I was doing was asking myself “why am I even paying for that app anymore?”</p>

<p>Listening to act two of <em>This American Life</em>’s episode <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/789/the-runaround/act-two-6" target="_blank">The Runaround</a>, in which we meet a boy who can only really calm his mind by running loops around the block, I can’t help but wonder: it’s beautiful to see a young problem-solver with ADHD make life easier for himself, but were there other people who thought of the compensatory behaviors often displayed by people with an eating disorder?</p>
