        <description><![CDATA[
          
          
          
          <br />
          <p>This morning I got acquainted with the immigrant anxiety felt by Chinese-American journalist Jiayang Fan about her desire to speak accentless English. In <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/786/its-a-game-show">an episode of one of my favorite podcasts, <em>This American Life</em></a>, Jiayang participated in a game show designed around a talent she claims to possess: the unique ability, inspired by her anxiety, to tell at what age a Chinese-American person came to the United States. The show gave her recordings of three people to prove herself. (She got 0 out of 3.)</p>

<p>Nothing human is alien to me, and neither is Jiayang’s desire to blend in phonetically.</p>

<p>Growing up in the Dutch South, I wasn’t ever unaware of my accent, but it took me enrolling in Utrecht University to become fully aware of the effect it had on others. I could barely make it through class participation without someone chuckling in the back row of lecture hall. I decided that, on the very day I found housing in Utrecht, I would change my accent. These days, few people can tell I’m from the South. I like it that way.</p>

<p>Another thing I’ve always been afraid to sound was “black”. In the Netherlands, that usually means sounding like you were born and (partially) raised in an African country, Suriname, or the Antilles. With no such history, I’m silly to think I could ever fall into that category, which is a fine category in itself. Still, every now and then people will tell me I sound Surinamese. Unable to shake my internalized racism, I always find myself offended when they do.</p>

<p>Today’s episode reminded me of the duality of being a person of color in a conversation about speech. Like Jiayang, I find myself comparing my speech to that of other Black people, forming opinions on what I think is or isn’t “good”. At the same time, I would find it problematic if other, non-Black people were doing it for me. To me, there’s nothing inherently wrong in that distinction; it’s important people can tell their own story and not have it told for them. I’m just struck by the number of times I asked “babe, is this the example we want to give?”</p>

          <p>Sometimes, when bad news arrives, I think to myself “argh, just when I was beginning to think life was nice and steady!” Today is one of those days. I’m immediately thrown off, though mostly by the scenarios playing out in my head. Not because of the particular fact of which I learn.</p>

<p>I’m disappointed by the rediscovery of life’s unsteadiness. At the same time, there’s beauty to be found. After all, there have been times in my life when I’ve been so anxious that bad news wasn’t an interruption, but a confirmation of what I already thought I knew.</p>

<p>Today, a cloud blocks the sun. I remind myself that it’s a whole lot better than rain all year round.</p>

          <p><a href="https://tech.lgbt/@zinzy/109698329736256912">As I already mentioned earlier today on Mastodon</a>, one of my favorite things about design work is getting to help other designers solve their own problems.</p>

<p>As one of the designers on my team and I were discussing how to leverage research to benefit stakeholder relationships, I saw a light switch on in her head that I think we’d have trouble turning off if we even wanted to. It’s so satisfying to see that happen, simply by mentioning a framework, sharing a bit of background on a particular research method, or on strategizing research within a product development process.</p>

<p>Coming back from product management into design management lets me focus wholeheartedly on this part of my skillset. I’m still not fully back at work (doing five hours a day now), but with encounters like this I’m beginning to feel more and more a part of the team again.</p>

<p>And I wouldn’t want it any other way.</p>

        <title>The art of music theory</title>
        <author> ()</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
          
          
          
          <br />
          <p>In a few days, I’ll hit my one-month mark on the piano. When I bought it and began playing, I made sure to keep an open mind about how I learn best; not following any particular method, but tailoring practices to my interests, speed, challenges, and desires.</p>

<p>One learning strategy that always works best for me is a top-down approach. With the piano, there’s great benefit in playing music from sheets (of which I’m capable), but I could tell something had been missing. This morning, as I woke early once again, this time at 03:20 a.m., I realized the missing part was an overview of which chords work in a particular key.</p>

<p>This morning over coffee at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ccjavaplein">my favorite spot</a>, I did some digging and found <a href="https://piano-music-theory.com/">Piano-Music-Theory.com</a>, which has a wonderful series on diatonic chords. If you’re not familiar, these are chords belonging to notes that make up a particular scale. Knowing the diatonic chords of each scale is going to benefit my flexibility on the piano, because I’ll be able to play songs in whichever key I need.</p>

<p>As I was drawing up a matrix of what I was learning, I remembered how special music theory really is. I love its intricacy and depth, and how it manages to capture one of life’s most extraordinary things: combinations of sounds that can tell a story.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
          
          
          
          <br />
          <p>More than any other time in my online life am I aware of the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text. I make a point to write image descriptions whenever I can. Kind strangers with a variety of accessibility needs have been helping me understand how to best capture my interpretation of an image. I’ve come to regard <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text as the secret side bar I get to have with blind people and others who need it.</p>

<p>For me, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text raises interesting cultural questions, particularly around its growing visibility. Traditionally, it requires that people who don’t use accessibility tools hover an image to produce what I call “the world’s slowest tooltip”. In addition, I’ve been seeing a growing number of people work <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text into places where it doesn’t exist. Places that don’t require a hover. Two examples of this are <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@zinzy">Mastodon</a>’s profile and banner images.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I saw the profile picture of a young woman winking. Her bio captured the image with something along the lines of “young woman looking seductively at the camera, winking, and slightly sticking out her tongue hoping to engage the viewer”. Before reading that text I felt engaged indeed, my mind painting a quick image of what her manic pixie dream girl university campus life would be like.</p>

<p>Reading her description of the image had an effect. I gather it was the overtness — her self-awareness about what the image could convey — that somehow put me off just slightly. The image and not so much her description of it but the very fact that I could even see that description, and that she understood I would, changed how I saw her in the image. It also changed how I see the Internet.</p>

<p>What does it mean, I’ve been thinking ever since, that people with no need for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text get to peek behind its curtain? What effect can this form of double meaning-making have? Does it mean we’ll eventually go on to describe images differently, knowing that not a portion of our audience but the entirety of it is looking on? Does it mean we may, some day, try to say less with imagery? In one way, I’d consider that reduction of fluff a triumph for accessibility.</p>

<p>Today, Piper Haywood’s blog <a href="https://piperhaywood.com/wais-alt-decision-tree/">put me onto a handy <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text decision tree</a>. I’m entirely surprised to read that the answer to the final question in the tree, “Is the image purely decorative or not intended for the user?”, is “use an empty <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code>” and not “don’t post the image”.</p>

<p>I guess that paints the best picture of how much of a reductionist I am.</p>

          <p>Have you heard? Anja and I are getting a dog. It was up in the air for a little while, but we got the confirmation yesterday that we’ll get first pick of a nest of eight adorable little Pembroke - Cardigan corgi mixes. We’re meeting the puppies for the first time on Sunday. Are you crying? I’m crying.</p>

<p><a href="/2022/12/30/2022-in-review/">2022 showed me</a> that there are serious drawbacks to being an A type personality. The way it helps Anja and I prepare for a puppy isn’t one of them. Too excited to sleep, I now <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@zinzy/109674435586703598">wake at 04:15</a> to formulate schedules, training OKRs, and crate strategies.</p>

<p>Annoyingly, I’ve now become one of those people who thinks they know a minuscule sliver of the dread expecting parents must feel, aiming to read all of the world’s parenting books before retiring on the idea that, at the end of the day, it’s all about intuition and consistency.</p>

        <title>'The Whale' for scale</title>
        <author> ()</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
          
          
          
          <br />
          <p>In one of the many jubilant reviews garnered by Darren Aronofsky’s latest film <em>The Whale</em>, one writer concluded that we shouldn’t judge a book by its cover. This was in reference to the morbidly obese main character who eventually dies, but not before we find out he developed an eating disorder out of grief. Here was a fat man who evidently had feelings despite his exterior. Ironically, I find myself doing just what the writer suggested I don’t: judge the film before I’ve seen it.</p>

<p>As a fat person, I’m surprised to have forgotten some of the tropes society has formulated about bodies like mine. It might be the time I’ve spent recovering from an eating disorder, my underuse of popular (and harmful) social media, or my Blur It Out browser extension, but I apparently had been living in a kinder world. Everything about <em>The Whale</em> puts a damper on that experience.</p>

<p>Many may marvel at Brendan Fraser’s stellar performance, I see a minstrelsy of fatness. While undoubtedly not its primary purpose, <em>The Whale</em> reminds fat people that life is absolutely different for people who are not like us. Non-fat people can use the film to reconcile with fatness, to see the humanity behind the physical. Fat people can get reacquainted with how they’re supposed to see themselves, employing <em>The Whale</em> for scale.</p>

          <br />
          <p>I have a feeling 2023 will be the year for weird movies that steal our hearts. Look at <em>Triangle of Sadness</em> and <em>White Noise</em>. Here you have two high-budget oddball films that I’d describe not as mumblecore but coastercore, pulling you from one weird subnarrative into another, not really making up their minds about what they are, and before you’ve formed a full opinion on it, the ride is over, but you loved it.</p>

<p>It reminds me of the dawn of black brutalist typefaces mixed with pastel and neon gradients in web design: you look at it and your body says “wtf” and your heart goes “yes”.</p>

<p>I’ll await further data to see if I have any type of a point.</p>

          <p>Now that we’ve reached its end, 2022 feels much calmer and steadier than the two previous years. The pandemic, a new job, and major cultural and political developments gave 2020 the rhythm of living in the eye — and sometimes in the fabric — of a hurricane. Made to wear the hand-me-downs of its older brother, 2021 felt much the same. What made 2022 different isn’t its overall rhythm, but the way it was interrupted. In the wake of this interruption, everything seems easier.</p>

<p>My 2022 was all about a pivot I made, inspired by the health consequences I was experiencing or facing. 2022 was the backdrop of a recovery journey that took me to the south of Europe, where, gazing out across the lavender-colored valleys of the Algarve, I underwent in-patient treatment for an ongoing eating disorder at <a href="https://humanconcern.nl/">Human Concern</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some things I learned there, and here, in 2022, as well as some of my favorite snapshots.</p>

<h3 id="i-finally-found-a-way-to-connect-with-that-intuition-everybody-has-been-raving-about">I finally found a way to connect with that intuition everybody has been raving about</h3>
<p>I spent my time in the Algarve rigorously simmering down. Without the usual rush of home life, work, and social engagements distracting me from what’s difficult, I learned to listen to what I deeply know to be true. Entering into that conversation, I’ve become better at noticing what effect everyday life has on me: the “rebound”, as we call it in yin yoga.</p>

<h3 id="the-design-flaw-that-neurodiversity-isnt">The design flaw that neurodiversity isn’t</h3>
<p>Another transformation this year was kickstarted by Elizabeth Filips, a London medical student and YouTuber who has shown me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2sS00egAzg">how I can better organize things and, well, <em>do</em> them</a>. All of my life, I’ve been known to learn quickly, think originally, and get bored easily. (This is why, as I’m writing this, I’m already playing a pretty solid Philip Glass on the piano I got a week ago, but I can’t sustain a simple tidying routine to save my life.)</p>

<p>I was never unaware of what this meant or what it’s called, but what I never <em>got</em> was how to work these traits. I always thought I was just bad at consistency. That I was to blame for it, and how I shouldn’t stop trying until I could build habits like everyone else. I’ve never heard Elizabeth use the word “neurodiversity”, but it’s refreshing to hear from someone in whom I can see myself. Thanks to what I learned from her, I spent a good portion of 2022 eagerly embracing my own learning strategies, optimizing for passion rather than consistency.</p>

<h3 id="it-may-be-valuable-to-jumpstart-a-connection-by-oversharing-but-usually-it-isnt">It may be valuable to jumpstart a connection by oversharing, but usually it isn’t</h3>
<p>In my treatment cohort were nine other women, each with a uniquely originated eating disorder. Sharing the most difficult things about our lives gave us a non-verbal language that runs on gut feelings, eyes meeting, and quiet hugs. Outside of these relationships, though, 2022 showed me the value of pacing myself, friendship-wise. New people came and went, and with the ones who stayed I shared an understanding: you can’t always jumpstart a connection by oversharing, overcommitting, overinvesting.</p>

<h3 id="surround-yourself-with-worthwhile-stories">Surround yourself with worthwhile stories</h3>
<p>I’ve given up on the need to be a reader. I have a strong confirmation bias for the idea that I don’t read enough to justify the literature degree I have. Because of it, I see people basking in the light of the books they’re reading everywhere I go. Six weeks in the Algarve with no books except the Bible I didn’t touch did wonders for me. Instead of my usual feelings of guilt, I’m more discerning about the stories with which I surround myself. Life is too short to spend it feeding my brain and soul with things that don’t make me feel better, more excited, and more curious about life. This made it easy to skip <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Them_(TV_series)#Reception">Them</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/10/opinion/the-whale-film.html">The Whale</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_the_Crawdads_Sing">Where the Crawdads Sing</a></em>.</p>

<h3 id="firstly-im-a-designer">Firstly, I’m a designer</h3>
<p>In 2022 I realized that I don’t want to be a Product Manager. Since 2020 I’d been dabbling in the field, combining it with Design Management at my place of work, Leeruniek. Working as a Product Manager taught me volumes on strategic decision-making, big-picture thinking, and motivating an entire company behind a roadmap. It made me stellar at knowledge work. Sadly, it didn’t leave me enough room to do the things I truly love: product research and design, and the operational and leadership aspects associated with them. After my extended sick leave, I’m reintegrating back at work, thoroughly enjoying the researcher and designer I once again have become.</p>

<h3 id="other-things-i-learned">Other things I learned</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Food is cool, but I must chill:</strong> with an eating disorder that masked itself as a snobbish foodie for well over a decade, I am wise to be careful when engaging with kitchen projects. After coming back from Portugal, a major shift has been the time I spend in the kitchen. The lesson is that weeknight dishes don’t have to take longer than an hour to prepare. I’ve committed to this with varying degrees of success.</li>
  <li><strong>Dogs aren’t so bad after all:</strong> if you know me in person, one thing you will understand is that, historically, I’m known to hate dogs. Bill Murray once noted that he’s “suspicious of people who don’t like dogs”, and I’ve always proudly countered that with “don’t trust people who are suspicious of people who don’t like dogs”. That being said, 2022 gave me the soft eyes required to decide with Anja that we will be making an effort to welcome a corgi into our home.</li>

<h3 id="things-i-loved">Things I loved</h3>

<h4 id="in-the-cinema">In the cinema</h4>
<p>I made good use of my <a href="https://www.cineville.nl/">Cineville</a> card this year, seeing 19 films in different <a href="https://www.cineville.nl/theaters">film houses in Amsterdam</a>. These are some highlights:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11559472/">Ali &amp; Ava</a>:</strong> I saw this three times in a fortnight, quickly falling in love with the sincerity and softness of the film (and, granted, also a bit with Claire Rushbrook). It propelled its title track “Radio” by Sylvan Esso to the top of my playlist.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11389748/">Mass</a>:</strong> I love me a good kammerspiel, and <em>Mass</em> is a perfect example of it. The excellent cast, tension building, handling of covert Christian themes, and the pain around school shootings took my breath away.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13352968/">Good Luck To You, Leo Grande</a>:</strong> Anja took me to see this the day after I returned from Portugal. Emma Thompson, who has been my favorite actress and not-so-secret crush since <em>Love, Actually</em> is just pure on-screen bliss. I thought her and Daryl McCormack’s dynamic was electrifying.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11127680/">Boiling Point</a>:</strong> this story is a fever dream, each scene making everything quietly worse than it already was. The one-take technique worked very well on me here, reminding me slightly of <em>Son of Saul</em> (to which Anja lets me compare nothing, but I’m not talking substance here), if it weren’t for the wider depth of field.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7322224/">Triangle of Sadness</a>:</strong> this film worked incredibly well for me because I didn’t know what was going to happen. I read somewhere that the director thought that having his head in the editing process so deeply made him lose sight of just how gruesome the vomiting scene was, but I thought it was just perfect.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10954984/">Nope</a>:</strong> this was my favorite film of the year. I need Jordan Peele to do well in life and art, and I’m glad he succeeded. The tangle of interpretations that <em>Nope</em> carries, combined with the sheer beauty and abundant safety of Black cinema made I had to see it twice in one week.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="in-my-ear">In my ear</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2ubfQRrDsy6MEOKfptWEFt?si=70e6b75a48fa41cd">UK garage</a></strong>: I’m at that age where, suddenly, I realize that this 90s genre was the soundtrack of an entire decade of my life. Songs, their memories secretly stored in my body for later retrieval, come on and I go “oh my… GOD.” These days, UK garage is a perfect soundtrack for work.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1GIPP103zfsythULEpsmdw?si=e8af6a7cd6d74ed5">The Great Escape</a></strong>: this song by Patrick Watson, which I learned to play on my piano the minute I got it, was the soundtrack of an important moment during my time in Portugal. I know it may read as a suicide song, but to me it reads as something different entirely.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2Qt8Z1LB3Fsrf6nhBNsvUJ?si=A9bEvaz7R7SOmX1r86zGTw"><em>Songs</em> by Adrianne Lenker</a></strong>: I don’t know what Adrianne sounds like at Big Thief, but her cabin-recorded set of quiet, almost mousy tunes, accompanied by beautifully simple guitar work, put its hooks into me in the autumn, and didn’t let go. “half return” is among my favorites.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6IiZemRMna678qNhiRkYI5?si=CvXOTbiRSiyFo6MnWs8Fcw">Bedouine</a></strong>: she is to me now what Norah Jones was to me twenty years ago. Like lying in a warm bath, like simmering down after a difficult day, like pouring hot tea into a thermos so I can have it for later. Hopefully moody, she is.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2Xb6wJYGi0QXwURw5WWvI5?si=c4edaf562d154d15">Right Down the Line</a></strong>: in a genre I call “beards and log cabins”, this song by Gerry Rafferty is so successful at creating a vibe that I love. In Portugal, I listened to it on repeat.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5qxXZwGd1HEH12g8vRjr4J?si=8da62d3c045447f8">Best Friends</a></strong>: this is another single-repeat song from my Portugal playlist. Little Dragon made it such a mood, reminding me of early college, beer, and people I never knew.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6AAYNz8jXvVlgG9IpYi42Z?si=8b9ae3a327584c3b">Hunnybee</a></strong>: this song by Unknown Mortal Orchestra came to me shortly after I returned from Portugal. I like its ability to sound both careful and casual.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead</h3>
<p>Here are my five objectives for 2023:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I continue working on recovering from my eating disorder</li>
  <li>I’ve developed and enjoy using new neurodivergent work and learning strategies</li>
  <li>I can play the piano well</li>
  <li>I can work fulltime again, doing things that excite me</li>
  <li>I’m a good dog parent</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m also hoping to integrate vegetarian (and still nutritionally complete) dishes into our weeknight cooking cycle, and to begin exploring artists on an album-by-album case, rather than as part of playlists. I need 2023 to be steadier than 2022, but no less engaging and educational. I hope yours will be amazing, adventurous, filled with love, and that it’ll give you what you want <em>and</em> what you need.</p>

<p>Happy New Year!</p>
