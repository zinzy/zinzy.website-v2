        <title>Annual review at 36</title>
        <author> ()</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
          <p>In one way or another, the number 36 has felt like a milestone birthday for a long time. As a tween, I imagined the glamorous autonomy that came with being 36 because I was hooked on watching the televised adventures of a foursome of privileged White women in Manhattan. Now, finally at 36, it feels important that I could‚Äôve had a child as an adult who would now also be an adult. I say ‚Äúadult‚Äù but we all remember the self-important idiots we were at 18.</p>

<p>I enjoyed reading <a href="https://www.designswarm.com/blog/2023/12/end-of-year-review-5/">Deschamps-Sonsino</a>‚Äô annual review, so here‚Äôs mine.</p>

        <title>A lifetime without representation</title>
        <author> ()</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
          <p>My friend and I reunite after 18 months. I missed him dearly, but once we sit down for ramen we can both tell it‚Äôs like we were there yesterday. I talk about him often. He‚Äôs the person who was so discombobulated by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/26029077">Dutch white innocence</a>, that he felt more comfortable going back to the Middle East to live in the closet. He‚Äôs doing better now. No more crack, and the spinning class is surprisingly inclusive. He even joined a theatre group.</p>

<p>‚ÄúRemember when you scolded me because my website was in Times New Roman?‚Äù I ask him. He doesn‚Äôt. Back when this happened, he was working a Dutch corporate job. Part of him, or perhaps all of him, must have been so embarrassed to learn he‚Äôd sent his UX-hopeful coworker to a webpage that looked like it never left the late nineties.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh look, another book on personal branding‚Äù I say as we walk into American Book Center. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs actually really what I need‚Äù he says. It‚Äôs because he‚Äôs hoping to be invited to SoHo House Amsterdam. ‚ÄúThat reminds me of, what‚Äôs her name‚Ä¶ Anna Delvey?‚Äù I say. That‚Äôs exactly what it is, he tells me. It‚Äôs a private place for selected Amsterdam creatives. A country club in the city.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great. You can‚Äôt take pictures in there, they let you connect with other creatives, and it‚Äôs 200 euros a month. My friend rebranded herself in such a brilliant way, check out this picture of her with her paintings on Instagram. She got an invite right away.‚Äù When I note that he moved a five-hour plane ride away from SoHo House Spuistraat, he seems surprised.</p>

<p>At Coffee Company, he shows me his blog, but he holds his hand over the title, of which I manage to catch a glimpse. It‚Äôs such a weird name I forget it instantly, but the writing is beautiful. I‚Äôm saddened by Gen Z‚Äôs inability to just use their own bleeding name for stuff. I don‚Äôt think the fragmentation is doing them any good.</p>

<p>I peer pressure him into getting one of those silly hand treatments at Lush, where the people always seem a little too eager to greet you. The person giving the treatment has a pronoun button on their apron, but still I get it wrong. ‚ÄúZinzy, her pronouns are they/them‚Äù my friend says. Minutes later, I joke how I need an applause for managing to use the correct pronoun. The two most oppressed people on Kalverstraat, and we‚Äôre mere inches away from becoming the boomers we avoid.</p>

<p>We finally land at Bar Bario, where the Callaloo Hoek staff has come down with covid. What a waste of a good appetite, I think, as I Uber us Ranchi sandwiches. Like two people on a date that can‚Äôt find its pace, we take turns asking each other questions from the jar on the table. ‚ÄúWhen was the first time you felt represented by the media?‚Äù I ask him. ‚ÄúNever‚Äù.</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>This</em> is your SoHo House,‚Äù I say, waving my arms feverishly at the Black pride on the walls and queer people of color at the bar. ‚Äú<em>Your</em> people are <em>here</em>‚Äù. He cries a little bit, but because he can‚Äôt escape the characteristics of his generation, I can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs faking it, method acting, or just unable to cry like a normal person.</p>

        <title>Week 47: Geert Milders</title>
        <author> ()</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
          <h3 id="covid">Covid</h3>
<p>It‚Äôs curious to see my response to a bout of Covid is not much different from what it was in early 2020. Despite a <a href="/2023/11/19/week-46">negative test</a>, symptoms tell me everything I need to know. I have to remind myself every day this week that, given the regulations, I‚Äôm not obliged to quarantine. Nevertheless, Anja and I are both barely able to walk the dog. I work half days, and spend my afternoons in bed with hot water bottles.</p>

<p>Later in the week, I have cabin fever that is so intense it makes me cry in the park a little bit. On Sunday, the only thing I‚Äôm left with is a stuffy nose as well as some fatigue. God, I hope I don‚Äôt develop long Covid.</p>

<h3 id="consuming">Consuming</h3>
<p>Anja and I watch season two of <em>Somebody Somewhere</em>. It makes me regain a new appreciation for Bridget Everett‚Äôs physical comedy, new sincerity, and sass. I wish she and I were friends.</p>

<h3 id="tinkering">Tinkering</h3>
<p>I make some changes to my website this week, centering a page of text with links on the homepage. Sometimes, I feel bad that I don‚Äôt take screenshots every time I change it. But I suppose my continuous redesign strategy prevents that from being realistic.</p>

<h3 id="politics">Politics</h3>
<p>On Wednesday, the country has her very own 2016 American election result: after 20 years of being (rightfully) ridiculed as a far right party, PVV is finally the biggest, taking 37 of 150 seats in the House. Most people in my safe, progressive, friendly Amsterdam that I‚Äôve spoken with are gobsmacked. Party leader Geert Wilders has become Geert Milders. A part of me is angry and sad, but a much larger part says: welcome to my world.</p>

        <title>Week 46: Osama</title>
        <author> ()</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
          <ul>
  <li>I‚Äôm making an attempt this week to make my weeknotes more of a personal record rather than a performance of how exciting my week is. What I‚Äôve written answers the question I might ask myself seven years from now: what was life like this week?</li>
  <li>I went on the road for on-site research on Tuesday, and was delighted by the particular nursing home that we visited. It seems many Dutch healthcare organizations have understood that environments that resemble the real-life environments of patients contribute to their overall wellbeing. The various spaces we saw were tailored to what life must have been like when the elderly clients were younger: a fifties barber shop, a diner-like restaurant. It was endearing. More professionally, I continue to be stunned by the working lives of people in healthcare. Having to balance tight budgets and strict schedules on the one hand and genuinely wanting the best for clients on the other is not an easy feat.</li>
  <li>It seems like I did pick up Covid while there.</li>
  <li>I‚Äôve begun watching <em>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters</em> and I love my life. The farther I become removed from the humanities major version of myself, the easier it becomes to admit I love monster disaster stories.</li>
  <li>I‚Äôve also begun watching the second season of <em>The Morning Show</em>, and two episodes in I understand why Anja urged me to really, <em>really</em> give it a try. Reese Witherspoon making out with Julianna Margulies is not the stuff of dreams I thought I needed, but here we are. Acting, storyline etc. also good.</li>
  <li>The Israel-Hamas War continues to rage, which has begun to feel like a weird name for the conflict. I wonder what it means that, when I Google those words, the Wikipedia entry to which I‚Äôm directed is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hamas_attack_on_Israel">
2023 Hamas attack on Israel</a>.</li>
  <li>I will never have first-hand experience of what it means to be a Jewish person in the world today, although I‚Äôve been having a second-hand experience that has been leaving me‚Ä¶ perturbed. When people discover my partner is Jewish, the tone of the conversation shifts. Not in a pro-Palestinian way, but in the way Jenna Maroney felt the urge to touch Liz Lemon‚Äôs hand after learning that Liz had met Oprah on a flight (which, of course, turned out to be a random Black woman).</li>
  <li>While I tested negative, I did spend Friday evening and night in bed with a fever and a body that felt as though it had been hit by a truck. Anja did test positive on Sunday, and so now we‚Äôre quarantining. March 2020 all over again.</li>
  <li>I keep thinking a lot about Osama Bin Laden. About the lack of context given by the journalist who shared parts of his <em>Letter to the American people</em> on social media. How TikTok and X, at least for a moment, were rife with people who were barely born when 9/11 happened, proclaiming support for Bin Laden because he had pro-Palestinian things to say. About the importance of digital literacy in the classroom.</li>
  <li>Whenever I‚Äôm ill, I bake or cook. I feel bad not doing anything and lying in bed all day, and following a recipe always seems like a good way to pass the time. This week, I made apple crumble custard <em>vlaai</em>. You can take the girl out of Limburg (and thank God for that), but‚Ä¶</li>

        <title>The artificial borders of climate activism</title>
        <author> ()</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
          <p>Yesterday at the Climate March, someone shouted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_river_to_the_sea#Criticism">‚ÄúFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free‚Äù</a>. It was an unfortunate thing. A clean example of the climate changing instantaneously among 85,000 activists.</p>

<p>I was there for four reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>My definition of God is ‚Äúscience is indescribably beautiful and we must respect her‚Äù</li>
  <li>I can‚Äôt think of a more regrettable waste of tax money than having to spend it on health issues we can prevent if only we take better care of our environment</li>
  <li>I have a weak spot for an activist friend, who, through stealth influencing, had instilled in me a deep sense of FOMO about the event</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_in_the_Netherlands">Dutch carnival season</a> had kicked off on November 11, and I was in the mood for a parade</li>
</ol>

<p>The phrase was understandable coming from the Palestinian woman. Still, I appreciate that its most vicious context of use taints it so ferociously with antisemitism that deploying it as a vehicle for unity is a recipe for disaster. The crowd was so immense that it took hours of dancing in place before we even got started on the route. By the time we got to Museum Square, the words had already left the woman‚Äôs mouth.</p>

<p>We got there just in time to watch Greta Thunberg, who had been marching with us, turning her face away from cameras to remind us of why she was there. In between her on the stage and us on the field there were three screens, each projecting her face from a distance. I <em>believe</em> she was there, but the crowd was too big to say anything with much certainty.</p>

<p>My activist friend is one of those rare white people: privileged enough to belong to the 1% of a <em>variety</em> of subgroups, yet so antiracist it brings a tear to your eye. A seeker of nuance and complexity. A political unicorn. As we stood in the longest line I had ever seen, sharing the weight of a ‚ÄúTHE CRISIS IS NOW‚Äù banner, I said to her: ‚Äúit‚Äôs so‚Ä¶ White here.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said, mildly embarrassed it seemed, ‚Äúit‚Äôs actually a huge problem for us that we could use some help with.‚Äù</p>

<p>Growing up in the Dutch South, there was a peculiar detail to the way I engaged with other people of color. I didn‚Äôt. There was no nod in the street, no tribe to which I belonged, no ‚Äúour stories of minority and loneliness resonate‚Äù. Color blindness was the tune, and we were dancing to it. After almost a decade in Amsterdam I‚Äôve come to consider this lack of acknowledgement poor behavior. There‚Äôs not a black person in the neighborhood I don‚Äôt know. I had forgotten my life wasn‚Äôt always like this, until yesterday. I counted no more than ten people of color in the crowd, and I exchanged looks with not a single one of them.</p>

<p>Whenever I find myself in a sea of vast whiteness, I ask myself: ‚Äúwhere am I, why are there no other people of color here, and should I <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5052448/"><em>Get Out</em></a>?‚Äù Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love white people. <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeOfMyBestFriendsAreX">Some of my best friends are white people.</a> My <em>wife</em> is a white person. Consider it a habit I‚Äôve developed growing up in the Netherlands, where nothing about ethnicity is quite as it seems.</p>

<p>What solidifies Greta Thunberg‚Äôs identity as a Zoomer is the radical solidarity she and her contemporaries practice, seemingly without effort. Once she finally got on stage, her first act of compassion was to return the word to the Palestinian woman whose sound had been disconnected immediately after she had said the phrase.</p>

<p>What followed is what you may expect to happen when a person traumatized by an active war has to find it in herself to pick up where she left off to tell 85,000 mostly white faces how climate justice and justice for Palestine can exist on the same stage.</p>

<p>It was <em>mayhem</em>.</p>

<p>Once Greta had the mic again, she decided to keep her speech brief, much to the dismay I‚Äôm sure of all the people who felt blessed to share a moment in Amsterdam with her. Not <em>so</em> brief, however, that a man couldn‚Äôt walk on stage and declare he was there for the climate and not for politics.</p>

<p>The respectability politics are vile today. All I can think about is the power of the speech that could have been. The one in which a Palestinian woman addresses a vast sea of white faces who all listen intently to her talk about climate change. The way she says the words ‚Äúriver‚Äù and ‚Äúsea‚Äù only when referring to natural bodies of water. The way she captivates her audience until the very end, when she pulls a Hannah Gadsby to remind us all of the hypocrisy and dangers of compartmental solidarity. The way she nods quietly to the upcoming elections.</p>

<p>The respectability politics are vile today. March-induced feelings of disappointment, uninspired virtue signalling, and racism find each other. A discombobulated display of on-stage pain and the very notion of pro-Palestinian sentiment have quickly been conflated into a rhetoric with which I feel increasingly uncomfortable: that people in power decide when minorities speak about their place in the world. That, when we talk about climate justice, every other topic must give way. That, when we march for a cause that seems to predominantly attract white people, unwritten rules of radical inclusion don‚Äôt apply. I feel the climate activism community interviewed for a job with me, and as a result I want to burn its r√©sum√©.</p>

<p>It makes me sad.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm sad because there are people who think climate justice can exist outside of politics. I‚Äôm sad because so many people don‚Äôt understand that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_personal_is_political">the personal is political</a>. I‚Äôm sad because I want to engage in climate activism, but I don‚Äôt feel there‚Äôs a place for me at the table. I‚Äôm sad because, right now, climate activism feels like a Gutmensch hobby. I‚Äôm sad for all the people who can‚Äôt tell the difference between antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment. I‚Äôm sad for our Uncle Eli from Tel Aviv who is in and out of his bomb shelter all day.</p>
