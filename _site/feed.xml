        <description><![CDATA[
          <p>I edit my biography in a community app for Black professionals. Other people use the flags of their heritage, and I decide to do the same. Which one goes first, üá≥üá± or üá∏üáπ? I was born in the Netherlands, and consider myself not Dutch per se but definitely an Amsterdammer. Truth be told, I‚Äôve never been to S√£o Tom√© and Principe, and the parent who hails from there left when he was ten. I wonder, brushing my teeth before bedtime, whether it‚Äôs appropriation for me to use the flag. And then I think of all the brown and Black faces I know, doing just the same, and entirely dignified and correct in doing what they do. It‚Äôs one of the prices of growing up Black in a white environment: I wonder when I‚Äôll stop feeling like <em>I‚Äôm</em> the racist.</p>

          <p>Hey dear Desi, a bit late, but as promised, here are some resources that may be helpful when diving deeper into UX:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Don‚Äôt Make Me Think</em>, <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em>, and <em>100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know About People</em> are books most UXers would recommend. In addition, <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/ux-design-books-guide">Interaction Design Foundation has a great overview of books</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://start.uxdesign.cc/">The Guide to Design</a> by uxdesign.cc is a great starting point</li>
  <li>Career Foundry has a nice overview of <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-become-a-ux-designer/">How to become a UX designer</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.uxmatters.com/">UX Matters</a> is perhaps my favorite resource on UX topics</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.userinterviews.com/ux-research-field-guide">UX Research Field Guide</a> by UserInterviews.com. It focuses purely on research practice, but it‚Äôs a comprehensive overview of all things involved in focusing on the U in UX.</li>
</ul>

          <p>New Year‚Äôs Eve is sweet. I spent the morning at Coffee Company Oosterdok working on my website. The girl barista and the guy who came to take over her shift are apparently dating. He‚Äôs got a full mullet and a geeky mustache. It‚Äôs that season of fashion again. He was the type of soft masculine only Gen Z-ers can be. At 36, I seem to be developing a habit of noticing how much I‚Äôm no longer an 18-year-old. Everyone who seems my age addresses me with the formal ‚Äúu‚Äù. I also saw S in the street. It‚Äôs the first anniversary of her father‚Äôs passing and she was wondering out loud what could properly trigger an ugly cry. She offered me a red velvet ‚Äúoliebol‚Äù, which looked like a fried dog treat. No thank you, ma‚Äôam. A friendly face in the neighborhood knocks on our window and tells me she has enjoyed getting to know us a little more, and that she hopes to be in touch more in 2024. 6pm and pizzas enter the oven. It took only 15 minutes for us to finally get into <em>Better Call Saul</em>. I expect I won‚Äôt even make it until midnight. Happy New Year!</p>

        <title>Annual review at 36</title>
        <author>zinzy@pm.me (Zinzy Waleson Geene)</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
          <p>In one way or another, the number 36 has felt like a milestone birthday for a long time. As a tween, I imagined the glamorous autonomy that came with being 36 because I was hooked on watching the televised adventures of a foursome of privileged White women in Manhattan. Now, finally at 36, it feels important that I could‚Äôve had a child as an adult who would now also be an adult. I say ‚Äúadult‚Äù but we all remember the self-important idiots we were at 18.</p>

<p>I enjoyed reading <a href="https://www.designswarm.com/blog/2023/12/end-of-year-review-5/">Deschamps-Sonsino</a>‚Äô annual review, so here‚Äôs mine.</p>

        <title>A lifetime without representation</title>
        <author>zinzy@pm.me (Zinzy Waleson Geene)</author>
        <description><![CDATA[
          <p>My friend and I reunite after 18 months. I missed him dearly, but once we sit down for ramen we can both tell it‚Äôs like we were there yesterday. I talk about him often. He‚Äôs the person who was so discombobulated by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/26029077">Dutch white innocence</a>, that he felt more comfortable going back to the Middle East to live in the closet. He‚Äôs doing better now. No more crack, and the spinning class is surprisingly inclusive. He even joined a theatre group.</p>

<p>‚ÄúRemember when you scolded me because my website was in Times New Roman?‚Äù I ask him. He doesn‚Äôt. Back when this happened, he was working a Dutch corporate job. Part of him, or perhaps all of him, must have been so embarrassed to learn he‚Äôd sent his UX-hopeful coworker to a webpage that looked like it never left the late nineties.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOh look, another book on personal branding‚Äù I say as we walk into American Book Center. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs actually really what I need‚Äù he says. It‚Äôs because he‚Äôs hoping to be invited to SoHo House Amsterdam. ‚ÄúThat reminds me of, what‚Äôs her name‚Ä¶ Anna Delvey?‚Äù I say. That‚Äôs exactly what it is, he tells me. It‚Äôs a private place for selected Amsterdam creatives. A country club in the city.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great. You can‚Äôt take pictures in there, they let you connect with other creatives, and it‚Äôs 200 euros a month. My friend rebranded herself in such a brilliant way, check out this picture of her with her paintings on Instagram. She got an invite right away.‚Äù When I note that he moved a five-hour plane ride away from SoHo House Spuistraat, he seems surprised.</p>

<p>At Coffee Company, he shows me his blog, but he holds his hand over the title, of which I manage to catch a glimpse. It‚Äôs such a weird name I forget it instantly, but the writing is beautiful. I‚Äôm saddened by Gen Z‚Äôs inability to just use their own bleeding name for stuff. I don‚Äôt think the fragmentation is doing them any good.</p>

<p>I peer pressure him into getting one of those silly hand treatments at Lush, where the people always seem a little too eager to greet you. The person giving the treatment has a pronoun button on their apron, but still I get it wrong. ‚ÄúZinzy, her pronouns are they/them‚Äù my friend says. Minutes later, I joke how I need an applause for managing to use the correct pronoun. The two most oppressed people on Kalverstraat, and we‚Äôre mere inches away from becoming the boomers we avoid.</p>

<p>We finally land at Bar Bario, where the Callaloo Hoek staff has come down with covid. What a waste of a good appetite, I think, as I Uber us Ranchi sandwiches. Like two people on a date that can‚Äôt find its pace, we take turns asking each other questions from the jar on the table. ‚ÄúWhen was the first time you felt represented by the media?‚Äù I ask him. ‚ÄúNever‚Äù.</p>

<p>‚Äú<em>This</em> is your SoHo House,‚Äù I say, waving my arms feverishly at the Black pride on the walls and queer people of color at the bar. ‚Äú<em>Your</em> people are <em>here</em>‚Äù. He cries a little bit, but because he can‚Äôt escape the characteristics of his generation, I can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs faking it, method acting, or just unable to cry like a normal person.</p>
