<p>Lemonade, Lemonade, Lemonade. Who knew I would ever become a dog person? Two weeks ago, we picked up our corgi Lemonade Zelda Loulé. There was a torrent of research both Anja and I did to prepare for this puppy. There was a birth announcement card. A <a href="https://www.anneliewambeek.com/" target="_blank">godmother</a> was appointed. Here are some things I learned after two weeks with a dog.</p>

<h3 id="the-roi-of-good-research">The ROI of good research</h3>
<p>Anja and I are both blessed with a-type personalities and a propensity for thorough investigation. Early on in our dog prep journey, we found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@McCannDogs" target="_blank">McCann Dogs</a>, a training school with a YouTube channel full of clear, concise, and highly-informative videos on how to raise a puppy.</p>

<p>Two weeks in, I can tell they taught us well. Lemonade hasn’t had an accident in the house since day three, she sleeps through the night aside from two or three potty breaks, and it’s great to see how quickly she’s picking up commands. A week before Lemonade arrived, we started on McCann’s course <a href="https://mydogcan.mccanndogs.com/courses/puppy-essentials" target="_blank">Puppy Essentials</a>, which has proven a great way to get through the first few weeks.</p>

<h3 id="i-got-cabin-fever">I got cabin fever</h3>
<p>Out of all the things I had anticipated in preparing for this puppy, cabin fever was not one of them. While Anja and I are both quite introverted (meaning we need to recharge whenever we’ve been around people), she seemed fine spending her spring break cocooning in the house. I, on the other hand, felt myself slowly going mad over the lack of stimulus I was getting.</p>

<p>Because of our potty training schedule, and lack of a big garden, I barely got out of the house the first week. Luckily, I quickly developed the habit of taking Lemonade out on walks, even if we didn’t actually let her <em>walk</em> just yet because of her exposure to possible diseases. It’s great to be out of the house again, go to my favorite coffee spot, and walk around the park with her.</p>

<h3 id="the-beauty-of-trust">The beauty of trust</h3>
<p>Aside from an outdoor rabbit, a bird, a chameleon, and a shy cat, I never had any cuddly pets. Being child-free on top of that never gave me the opportunity to closely bond with another small being who trusts me enough that they’ll fall asleep on my body. Lemonade is very cuddly, and it’s entirely humbling to experience the trust she seems to have in me.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h3>
<p>I’m excited to enroll her in puppy training a few weeks from now. For the time being, she’s hanging out with trusted pets in the neighborhood, and getting to know many visitors. Looking ahead, I’m also pumped about finally taking her to the park and playing fetch with her.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2021/05/02/3-years-sober/">3 years sober</a></h2>
    </header>
    <html><body>
<p>On May 2, 2018, as we got off the plane from Stockholm, completing our visit with Anneli and Milan, I said calmly to Anja:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think I may try not drinking for a week or so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing dramatic had happened in Stockholm. We had just returned from a midweek staying with friends in the city, followed by a couple days at a cozy cabin in the woods. It was my first time meeting these friends and they are wonderful people: two kind-hearted, curious journalists and their young daughter. The father is an excellent home chef, and so we quickly bonded over soul food, shared political views, and wine.</p>

<p>Alcohol wasn’t on my mind at all. I didn’t drink more than three glasses of red during my entire stay with them. Instead, Anja and I were just… part of their warm family dynamic. Eating jubileumskaka for breakfast, reading stories before bed. I was overwhelmed by how secure I felt in their presence, so much so that I cried when we left. It was a week to remember. Looking back, I can see that it must have been this sudden sense of security, entirely unfamiliar to my person, that made me realize what I needed.</p>

<h3 id="embracing-sobriety">Embracing sobriety</h3>
<p>That one week of not drinking has yet to end (and I don’t plan for it to). Those first few months after our Stockholm trip, not drinking was embarrassingly easy. I had done it before, and Anja doesn’t really ever drink, and so our dinner parties, get-togethers, and outings were never awkward for me. I didn’t even celebrate my one year of not drinking because it just… wasn’t a thing to me. I didn’t even feel like I was sober. Not until the email.</p>

<p>I have a dear childhood friend who is as troubled a soul as I was for a long time. I’m not saying that to sound like a know-it-all, I’m just in a different place now. They have a habit of only reaching out to me when they’re doing well, and so whenever things are rough, they fall off my radar. We hadn’t spoken in a while and when they did in the late Fall of 2018, the good news was that they were entering into rehab. The bad news had been that they had fallen homeless and that they were battling a coke addiction on top of  what I had already identified as a dependency on other substances.</p>

<p>By the time Valentine’s Day of 2019 rolled around, I received an email from their sister with the invitation to write my friend an intervention letter. They would be using mine, as well as those of another friend and a few relatives to support my friend’s treatment program.</p>

<h3 id="sobriety-means-alcoholic">Sobriety means alcoholic</h3>
<p>My first draft of the letter was ready within the hour. I’ve always been at ease with writing, and so putting into words what my friend’s addiction had done to me was fairly easy. I let Anja read the letter right away. Once she finished, she looked up at me with a face full of discomfort. “What’s wrong?” I asked her. After hesitating for a few moments, she said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I hope you won’t be mad when I tell you this, but I don’t think this is entirely true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wasn’t mad. I just didn’t really understand what she was talking about. My letter was heartfelt and kind, hopeful and supporting, and I had explained to my friend how their drinking made them an untrustworthy friend, how their asking for money was awkward, and how much it hurt. Anja saw more than that.</p>

<p>Slowly, she started uncovering some truths that I hadn’t ever acknowledged, at least not to their full extent.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You know, I recall you making comments about their drinking and drug use quite often, when in reality your relationship with alcohol isn’t super healthy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had known that for some time. Heck, I hadn’t even had a drink in almost a year. Not drinking comes with a few perks, though. One of them is that you don’t have to acknowledge that your drinking is actually a problem. That day was the first day that I realized that my relationship with alcohol makes me an alcoholic. I was in such denial about that for so long that my childhood friend’s problems had come to function as a lightning rod.</p>

<h3 id="filling-in-the-blanks-i-had-forgotten-were-there">Filling in the blanks I had forgotten were there</h3>
<p>Since I’ve emotionally transitioned from being simply dry to being sober, a whole new world has opened up. I get to look at my family’s relationship with alcohol with much more clarity. I can see how alcohol was my ultimate vice in battling feelings of unworthiness, and how it oddly enough magnified those feelings. My subconscious is slowly filling in the blanks that I had forgotten were there. To me, alcohol equates forgetting, forgetting, forgetting. So much forgetting, in fact, that I didn’t even know how much I’m supposed to remember.</p>

<h3 id="what-needs-mending">What needs mending</h3>
<p>With a minimized dependency on alcohol, I have started to work on things that have been with me for decades. And I have a sobriety counter on my watch. I don’t <em>need</em> the reminder every day, but I want it. I think of <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/philip-seymour-hoffmans-last-days-77972/" target="_blank">Philip Seymour Hoffman</a> a <em>lot</em>. After successfully completing their rehab program, my childhood friend is back on drugs again, and supporting themselves with escort work. There’s a very fine line between me and that. For a long time I thought it was studying it in detail and deriving life lessons from it. Today, I celebrate 1095 days of making the right decision, and a little over two years of turning inward to see what needs mending.</p>

<p>After five years of learning, falling on my face, making friends, and getting to know the travel industry, the time has come for me to say goodbye to <a href="https://airtrade.com" target="_blank">Airtrade</a>. This year, the travel industry took a huge blow, with many of the small and big clients we’ve acquired over the years in serious heavy water. What’s more, five years is a good run, wouldn’t you say?</p>

<p>My next adventure is taking me even deeper into making tools for people at work, and I couldn’t be more thrilled. I’m joining <a href="https://leeruniek.nl" target="_blank">Leeruniek</a>, a startup creating data-driven educational technology. They’re a smaller team than what I worked with the past five years, and I’m curious to see what impact that has on the way I work.</p>

<p>There are a lot of interesting challenges to take care of at Leeruniek, and I’m eager to get my hands dirty!</p>

    <html><body>
<p>Amsterdam’s patient zero is a woman who just happens to have spent early 2020 in the north of Italy. She has a son who attends the high school which just happens to be Anja’s place of employment. Anja is the first person I know to be infected with Covid 19. I am the second.</p>

<p>Working in travel technology, my experience of the outbreak of Covid 19 was colored by coworkers wondering by the water cooler what all the fuss was about. The most vocal among them are Rotterdammers, a people known, if anything, for its no-nonsense approach to trouble.</p>

<p>Anja and I have a different disposition. Both of us have sensitive danger antennas. They were activated on numerous occasions since late last year, with us getting increasingly more worried every time the word “Covid” was mentioned on the news.</p>

<p>Still, by early March, I was coming into the office every day, telling myself I was being too cautious. Until one day…</p>

<p>Looking back, I suppose I’m lucky to have one colleague with an immunocompromised wife. I’ll never forget the way he leaned back in his chair when I came closer to ask him a question. Rightly so, it turned out, because within a day Anja developed a cough I had never heard before in my life.</p>

<p>I know it’s difficult to imagine, but travel back with me to the beginning of this year. “We’re fine, this virus won’t reach us. And if it does, it’s not life-threatening for most of society” the government said.</p>

<p>“Could you please stop calling, ma’am? I’ve told you before it’s just a mild flu for people your age, and we won’t be able to do anything for you anyway if you come in”, my doctor’s assistant said.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until two weeks in that Anja was invited to come to a pop-up testing facility. Not the ones we have now, but a doctor’s office somewhere in Amsterdam that had been turned into a quarantine zone, people in white suits everywhere. Two weeks after that, we had an appointment at the hospital, which had built a testing facility in the parking lot. I waited outside in a tent with a heater as Anja underwent a battery of tests.</p>

<p>The man who went in before her was admitted to the ICU. I prayed rosary after rosary, wondering how in the world I’d get the car home without a license. What felt like hours was really 18 minutes when Anja walked out of the facility. Her cough was terrible, but it wasn’t long Covid. Meanwhile, my Covid was barely a sniffle.</p>

<p>For a while, I used Instagram to chronicle our experiences. I was getting hundreds of messages a day, and sharing little stories on the platform was a quicker way of updating everyone. I was just going through the archive and noticed that, at some point, the Covid-themed stories just stopped. It’s because, after six weeks or so, Anja slowly started to feel better.</p>

<p>No long Covid, no long-lasting results, a little bit of tiredness. We’re okay again. Life continues as normal, except that everything is different. The travel industry has plummeted into a deep, deep crisis. The end of the school year was bizarre, and we’re enjoying the Summer with walks in the park and watching television. Anticipating that my career might be ready for a change, I’ve been busy applying for new jobs, and I just signed a new contract.</p>

<p>Nothing is the same.</p>

<p>But at least we’re okay. People around us have been getting ill, severely ill, some of them dying. Working from home isn’t ideal, specifically because we’ve turned our little shoebox of a living room into a two-person office, but we’re getting by. We have each other, and we have <em>Ratched</em>.</p>

<p>Proudly nasty, I joined Anja, my mother-in-law Sauci, and millions of others around the world last Saturday to attend the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Women%27s_March" target="_blank">Women’s March</a>. Museum Square in Amsterdam was full of pussy hats, face paint, smiling faces, and righteous indignation.</p>

<p>I don’t often attend protests, not in the last place because I’m cautious about negative media outlets that often ridicule protesters, but I loved being a part of this day. I have no idea what’s in store with this American presidency, but I imagine it can’t be very positive. I feel fortunate to live in a place that lends itself well to such protests. It makes me feel less scared and less alone.</p>

<p>What a time to be alive.</p>

    </header>
    <html><body>
<p>I remember it well, my transition from elementary to high school. Gone were the old days of person teaching every subject in a single classroom. Everything would be new again. New subjects, new people, teachers, supplies. It was the supplies that kept me up at night. Books were to be given the right cover, of course there would have to be a new pencil case. New notebooks. A diary.</p>

<p>Choosing was never my strong suit. I could stand there for hours, by the neatly arranged tables of school supplies. After all, they would have to last me the entire school year. The right supplies, this I figured, would lead to the right achievements. I was so young back then.</p>

<p>Year after year I’d find myself biking to town in the Summer months. Cover paper, new pencils, a nice fountain pen, snazzy fineliners. Preferably all the things.</p>

<p>Today, I went to shop for new supplies. I’ll be starting my freshman year of university, after a one-year hiatus. I hadn’t made a list, I figured a veteran like me could do without it on a trip like this. As soon as I’d get to the store, all the requirements would come to me.</p>

<p>The one thing I was keen on finding was a four-subject notebook, one for each course. And after that? Well, that was about it. I did already have a pencil case. And a fountain pen. And pencils. And binders. And a backpack. And a diary.</p>

<p>Home I went, with a teeny tiny plastic bag and two A5 notebooks.</p>

<p>After nine years, I realize I have everything I need. I no longer believe I need certain things to achieve my goals. Now it’s just a matter of doing the work, with everything I need just within reach.</p>

<p>Let’s go.</p>
