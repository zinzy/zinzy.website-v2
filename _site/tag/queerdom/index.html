<p>She blesses Anja, me, and a handful of other people who carved out time in their Sunday evenings to come to Church. I have never been inside this particular church building before, and chuckle at how <em>new</em> the Old Catholic decor is: in imagery and candle lighting possibilities it’s reminiscent of the average Dutch Roman Catholic church. Its white walls and central heating tell me something different.</p>

<p>You may think I chose this church because the woman blessing us is Desmond Tutu’s daughter, the Reverend Canon Mpho Tutu van Furth, and because Anja and I can’t help but fangirl. I’m here because she’s a Black queer person leading a church service that I can attend in person. I never thought I would see the day.</p>

<p>Dare I wonder whether I have found a new church in <a href="https://allsaintsamsterdam.com/" target="_blank">All Saints Amsterdam</a>?</p>

    </header>
    <html><body>
<p>The tourists are back in town. Lots of Germans with face masks. I suppose we’re all beginning to venture out into the world again, just a bit closer to home. Anja and I are considering taking the ferry to Norway. Apparently you can camp virtually anywhere in that country, as long as you “leave it cleaner than you found it” and make sure you’re gone after two days. At this point, we’re vastly underestimating how attached we are to luxury. I can still hear myself whining “Bonsoihoir”. This was the catch-all name we used anyone who would come to the door of our Parisian hotel room with a bucket of ice, “no, not for champagne, just for the drinks”. I also really don’t like ticks, and I simply can’t imagine that Norway somehow doesn’t have the national health crisis taunting its neighbor.</p>

<p>We’ve begun hosting dinner parties again. <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022421-bulgogi-eggplant" target="_blank">Eggplant bulgogi</a> and <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/2020/01/roasted-squash-and-tofu-with-ginger/" target="_blank">roasted squash with soy-glazed gingery tofu</a> make for a great Asian fusion. With a side of steamed rice and homemade furikake, of course. I also seem to be making improvements with the dough I typically use to make challah and jam buns. The buns came out spectacularly well and were fluffy and delicious even without having been covered during the refrigerator proofing.</p>

<p>At work, I’m preparing for our new designer to join the team. Practically, this means cleaning up our documentation and our design system so that she has a place to land rather than a hot mess. I’m being more verbose than I normally am in my design documentation, and having to write about my decisions makes me notice all the techniques and frameworks I’ve come to use over the years. One of my favorite’s is Cohesive design, which is now so second nature that I forgot I didn’t even think of it myself.</p>

<p>On Sunday I watched a few horror films, <em>Midsommar</em> being the favorite. I also watched <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> (2022), which wasn’t even that bad until I got to the final scene. Anja and I are watching season 4 of <em>Killing Eve</em>, which I imagine and hope will be the last season. Assassin résumé aside, I get Villanelle. I get every little bit of her.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2021/07/12/when-jesus-sent-out-his-twelve/">When Jesus sent out his Twelve</a></h2>
    </header>
    <html><body>
<p><em>This was written as part of <a href="https://www.vineandfig.co" target="_blank">Vine &amp; Fig</a>’s Sunday Scripture reflection project.</em></p>

<p>When Jesus sent out his Twelve, He told them: “Whatever place does not welcome you or listen to you, leave there and shake the dust off your feet in testimony against them.” If you’re not welcomed, not listened to, quietly withdraw. Don’t make a scene. Shrug your shoulders and be on your way.</p>

<p>Last week, a friend of ours in the Vine &amp; Fig community asked me to proofread a letter. It was addressed to her parents, and it asked, in the calm voice of a young woman embracing adulthood, whether or not she and her female partner could count on the same respect, dignity, and love that she saw flow from her parents to her siblings and their partners. Our friend and her partner had just moved in together, and things had gotten serious enough that an introduction was in order, even for her huge anti-queer Catholic family.</p>

<p>The letter asked, and it did not barter.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is not the first draft,” she tells me after I compliment her vulnerability and bravery, “the first one was me basically begging to be loved.” From where I’m sitting, I can see that this isn’t the first time our friend has had to beg. Her father and mother never seemed to have <em>gotten</em> this whole queer thing. They’ve been waiting for “this phase” to end for years. In their household, there is simply no “love for the gays”. It took a conversation with our friend’s future mother-in-law to make her look at her parents with her eyes open a little wider.</p>

<p>“You don’t need your parents as much as you think you do” the woman had said.</p>

<p>I imagine our friend crawling out from under the rubble left by the type of guilt only a Catholic parent can channel. I imagine the many lives in our community, with varying degrees of urgency, transforming as we come to understand the difference between a hurt that grows from love and one that grows from neglect.</p>

<p>I imagine all of us building a home, knocking on doors to see who will help us share love the way we see it, and learning to shake the dust off our boots and moving right along, even if it requires making a whole family from scratch.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2021/03/25/she/">Call me 'she' but not 'woman'</a></h2>
    </header>
    <html><body>
<p>The world beyond the gender binary is vast and diverse. As a queer facilitator, I’ve come to appreciate the value of writing my pronouns behind my name when it shows up in a video call or on Slack. It makes it easier for people to be good allies to those of us who have come to use pronouns they weren’t assigned at birth.</p>

<p>As a non-binary person, one of the choices I have had to make was on the topic of pronouns. Surprisingly to some, I use “she”, but really I’ll listen to anything that’s not “it”. Multiple people have asked me why this is so. After all, isn’t the whole notion of being non-binary a departure from the “she” that I was assigned at birth?</p>

<p>Yes, but also…</p>

<p>I don’t mind “she”. To me, “she” is camp. A Bette Midler song, a Wendy meme. The affection with which Meryl and Goldie address each other in <em>Death Becomes Her</em>. A woman can be a “she”, and so can a non-binary or genderqueer person, a man, or a lamp.</p>

<p>Being called “she” doesn’t hurt my reality beyond the binary. On the contrary, it amuses me. Whenever I hear someone refer to me as “she”, I giggle a little, as if someone just ran a finger across my spine. It’s cabaret to me, because that person likely doesn’t use the same defition of “she” as me. This tickling of my sensibilities brings me much more delight than deciding what pronoun works best for me. None of them do.</p>

for a year or so<br>
it’ll look so beautiful next to<br>
the ex-gay book<br>
your other sister presented to you<br>
on your birthday last month</p>

<p>At family dinner you<br>
spend bathroom breaks in your<br>
childhood bedroom<br>
five in total<br>
logging on to talk to us<br>
about how the heavy things feel<br>
being the punching bag<br>
on which your 11-year-old cousin<br>
practises her right hook<br>
screaming fire about<br>
her trans classmate<br>
stings<br>
and<br>
it stings<br>
like a shattered jaw</p>

<p>Your father-in-law planned a<br>
Christmas pub crawl of sorts<br>
Covid-style<br>
each of the siblings hosting<br>
the entire family<br>
for a portion of the day<br>
hopping from house to house<br>
eating, drinking, loving the way only<br>
a big family will<br>
At the fourth stop you are full<br>
zonking off into the distance<br>
catching the smiling face of your<br>
sister-in-law on the way there<br>
and you remember what<br>
it felt like when<br>
she wouldn’t come to
your lesbian wedding</p>

<p>For you and them<br>
there is no Family<br>
not since you came out as non-binary<br>
and your parents<br>
yelled<br>
“check please”<br>
the only trace of<br>
those you came from<br>
is the card your grandmother sent<br>
She writes “I wanted you to<br>
know I support you”<br>
She is a sweetheart<br>
it is a teardrop in the desert<br>
that you cling to</p>

<p>Your father was no exception<br>
first the pandemic<br>
now the respirator<br>
the store has been extra busy these days<br>
but you’re getting by<br>
it’s keeping your mind off<br>
of how much he was hoping<br>
you’ll find a girl someday soon<br>
Today, the phone call<br>
from the hospital<br>
lets you know that<br>
he can come home for Christmas<br>
The disappointment you feel<br>
sits in your body like a monster</p>

<p>You have all the time in the world<br>
to tell me how you’re doing<br>
but not a moment to yourself<br>
to commit to the act<br>
with all those relatives in the house<br>
prone to restricting themselves to<br>
those parts of the Bible<br>
that make Christianity look easy<br>
and you being back<br>
in the home of your youth<br>
after the attempt<br>
confirms what you fear and<br>
what your parents have been saying<br>
is true about your life<br>
“I have no love for the gays in my heart”<br>
your father said<br>
You wonder how gay<br>
he knows you are<br>
I wonder where you’ve hidden<br>
the Pride flag that I sent you<br>
as a housewarming gift</p>

<p>Colossians 3:26 The freedom of the Lord is the wisdom to decide who is truly your sister, your brother, your father, your mother. Don’t let the bastards grind you down.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2020/11/29/of-bridges-and-neighbors/">Of bridges and neighbors</a></h2>
    </header>
    <html><body>
<p>When I first learned that ‘pontifex’, Pope Francis’ Twitter account, is Latin for ‘bridge builder’, I was entirely delighted. “How wonderful”, I thought, “that our institution sees the value in a Pope who builds bridges between the Church and the rest of humanity.”</p>

<p>When I look at myself with kind eyes, I dare to see the ways in which I myself help build these bridges. As a queer facilitator, I’m part of the leadership team at Vine &amp; Fig, a community for affirming LGBTQIA+ Catholics. When it comes to the bridge between us and the rest of the world, I focus most of my efforts on building not the bridge’s deck but its foundation. The part that contains the strong back and self love required to even begin thinking about making it to the deck, which is where all the difficult dialogues happen. You know, the ones about whether or not we’re inherently disordered and whether we should ever experience physical intimacy.</p>

<p>This image of a bridge stretching from the feet of one group to another fits in beautifully with my theology. That which is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor. That is the whole Law, the rest is commentary.</p>

<p>My fantasy of pontifical bridges stretching from one people to the next was quite short-lived. “It’s a bridge between mankind and God, babe, not Catholics and everybody else”, my partner mumbled. An anti-clerical lesbian raised on the feminism of her Jewish hippie mom, she doesn’t own a pair of rosy glasses polished by my warm memories of Christmas-time pews overflowing with chilly bodies in warm coats. The Church does not invoke tender feelings of heritage for her. Wikipedia told me she was right about where that bridge leads.</p>

<p>While our Pope is our bridge, he is also a model. He reminds us, simply by showing up, that we must strive for a connection with God; one that will help us believe the correct thing and do what is righteous, so that we will not be forgotten when the time comes. We dream, for ourselves and for our neighbors, of bridges, thick as concrete, paved smoothly with whatever pleases the Lord as well as our abstinence from sin. We have that light, and by God, we will bring salvation to the ends of the Earth.</p>

<p>Today, as we read Romans 10, which is to say Paul’s conversion strategy for the Jews and Gentiles, we get to meditate on that light, and how beautiful it is that we can share it with our neighbors. In the days of the men who wrote what we’ve come to know as the Pauline Epistles, the act of embracing Gentiles and Jews alike in the image of Christ must have been such a beautiful, tender aspiration. Today, however, their words evoke something different altogether. They remind me that those of us who don’t think the Epistle to the Romans should come with a trigger warning, simply haven’t spent enough time with actual Jews. Or really any person who has felt the foot of the Church on their own foot.</p>

<p>See, there’s a thing us Christians are primed to overlook when we engage with the world, filled with the warmth of Jesus: we are taught to long for that strong spiritual connection with The Above so fervently, that we often do it at the expense of whoever else is with us in The Below. Why do so many of our bridges lean on the backs of others?</p>

<p>Tell the Jews the Messiah has already come and how they’re missing out. Make sure you make ‘em really feel it. Take their book and forget it was ever even theirs. Don’t vaccinate. Don’t gay. Choose purity culture over an actual human’s life, choose a pastor over a child. Choose a child over a woman, choose one color over the others. Go to Africa and do things so that you feel charitable. Go anywhere but home to help your neighbor.</p>

<p>As we welcome the Season of advent — and truly, I hope it will fill our sore hearts with anticipation and longing — I want to begin reimagining the bridge between myself and God. May it be paved with whatever pleases Her as well as my abstinence from sin. May it remind me that I am allowed a seat at the table, and that this table is one to share. May my bridge be made up of all the bridges I build between myself and my neighbors, so that we may travel between this island and another.</p>

    </header>
    <html><body>
<p>Let’s meditate on us scattered sheep today, shall we? After all, if not scattered, then what are we? It has become a running gag in our household. I will be reading the New York Times, shaking my fist at whomever is responsible for the failed separation of Church and State. Or perhaps I’m mad at those who think their Christian inclination allows them to dictate what happens in other people’s bodies. My Jewish partner will do the eye roll of eye rolls and say: “funny how you all kind of <em>do that</em>, wouldn’t you agree?”</p>

<p>She’s right: we Christians have a peculiar propensity for thinking ourselves better than the rest. And I’m not talking communal, but rather individual superiority. It’s really quite basic. We all have our individual interpretation of what signifies the core and what is merely peripheral in God’s message to the people. I may very well believe that God’s love can triumph when we give queer people room to breathe (which is to say to live, love, and all that comes with it), but another equally Christian Christian may think this triumph of love requires the exact opposite response. Despite this reality, we deem ourselves the Good Follower, and the other one Not A Real Christian.</p>

<p>Hell is other people.</p>

<p>When I open my Bible to Ezekiel 34, I hear the echo of the Parable of the Lost Sheep:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesn’t he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it? And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.’ I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s something so tender and kind in both these texts; no matter who or where or how lost, we are all equally important to God. Even when we sin, through repentance we can be found again. But who is a sinner and who needs repentance?</p>

<p>To many people in the flock, the entire Vine &amp; Fig community is a sinner in need of repentance. Disguised as well-intended good Christian ministry, their anti-queer violence saturates our daily lives. And let’s be clear: when I say violence, I don’t just mean the 350 trans and gender diverse individuals who were murdered in the past twelve months. I mean your brother who didn’t come to your wedding, and your mother who keeps saying she “doesn’t believe in gender diversity”. I mean your employer who forces you to sign a document indicating that you condemn homosexuality while you try to hide your girlfriend from your Instagram timeline. I mean the godawful things your siblings parrot over Sunday supper, and your father reminding them all that he has no love in his heart for gay people.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ, it’s great that you have your flock, my man, but should we queer people even want to be a part of it?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>I’d like to think ‘yes’.</p>

<p>Because hell is other people, and during our journey towards them we encounter God. When I dive deeper into Ezekiel 34 and the Parable of the Lost Sheep, the words take on a new meaning. To me, they are not a personal consolation, reminding me that I will be found if I’m lost. They tell me, above anything, that I am part of a single enormous flock, made up of everyone, filled with people whom I think are lost, and who, in turn, believe that I’ve gone astray. The passage tells me to love God above all else, and my neighbor as myself. Even if that neighbor is keeping their foot on my foot.</p>

<p>“What might that love look like?” we all rightfully ask, immediately. In my case, love may be a ‘yes’ and it may be a ‘no’.</p>

<p>A “yes, you are right, thank you for teaching me about yourself.”</p>

<p>Or a “no, what you are saying about me and my siblings is false, destructive, and traumatizing. Here, let me help you see things through a new lens so that we can coexist.”</p>

<p>Through God, I am granted the wisdom to know the difference.</p>

<p>If you are at all involved in queer Catholic Twitter, you know that last week was a riot. Cause célèbre was an unexpected shout-out from Pope Francis:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pope Francis told a group of parents of L.G.B.T. children yesterday that “God loves your children as they are” and “the church loves your children as they are because they are children of God.” — <a href="https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2020/09/17/pope-francis-parents-lgbt-children-god-loves-your-children-they-are" target="_blank"><em>America Magazine</em></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>My timeline was flooded, and understandably so: the Catholic Church hasn’t profiled itself as a boundary-pushing institution on very many occassions. My most vivid recollection of the Church’s stance on sexual matters is <a href="https://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091004222624/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/abuse/abuse08.htm" target="_blank">JP II blaming the child abuse horror on the gays</a>.</p>

<p>Since I became involved in queer Catholic collective <a href="https://vineandfig.co/" target="_blank">Vine &amp; Fig</a>, I have learnt something about myself and that is that I am very privileged. While many of my queer Catholic siblings fight daily battles for their identities and experiences with the people in their homes and lives, I’m only a single Pride Week removed from walking into Sunday Mass in a three-piece rainbow suit and a pink yarmulke.</p>

<p>Because of this privileged confidence, I appreciate the shout-out, but I have no need for it. I know that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>God “endorsed” LGBTQ+ people when he created us. — <a href="https://twitter.com/mattnightingale/status/1308564653547466753" target="_blank">Matt Nightingale</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Still, to most affirming queer Catholics everywhere, Pope Francis’ message was a godsend.</p>

<p>But.</p>

<p>Pope Francis certainly is not the first religious person to say that we queer individuals are children of God. Many affirming religious institutions, organizations, and individuals paved the way for him.</p>

<p>There’s something here that requires our close attention.</p>

<p>Welcoming-yet-staunchly-anti-queer congregations, Christians evangelizing ‘hate the sin, love the sinner’ rhetoric, and conversion ‘therapy’ programmes have been saying that we are loved by God for decades. Their message doesn’t ever usher in the paradigm shift we hope for. Much rather, it invites queer people to be vulnerable, and then once we are, things take a turn for the worse.</p>

<p>‘Queer people are children of God’ can be a godsend, <em>and</em> it can be a dog whistle. A poetic way of saying ‘oh it’s okay to <em>be</em> queer, it’s just very wrong to do it’, without having to take full responsibility for the origin and ramifications of your anti-queerness. After all, if your conviction is that queerness is a character flaw and not a glorious attribute inextricably connected to the soul, then technically you’re not lying. It’s a simple ‘Queer people are children of God, they just need to be saved’, if you want it to be.</p>

<p>This particular form of anti-queerness has the potential to be much more damaging than the odd ‘hey you, dyke!’ I may receive in the streets of Amsterdam. It reels us in and makes us believe we are safe. It is reminiscent of the dad in <em>Get Out</em>, who would’ve voted for Obama a third time but who also performs horror procedures on Black humans in his basement. It’s reminiscent of the friendly, middle-aged, Austrian trumpet player who has a nazi shrine for a basement in <em>Im Keller</em>.</p>

<p>‘The church loves our children as they are’ unsettles me, because I have been on the receiving end of an anti-queerness (and a racism, for that matter) that is very friendly and welcoming at face value. Its eventual uncanniness is <em>terrifying</em>. I want to know what’s in the basement. And as you know: with every good story, there’s always a basement.</p>

<p><em>This was <a href="https://vineandfig.co/blog/2020/pray-tell-clobber" target="_blank">originally published</a> as part of the Vine &amp; Fig “Pray Tell” project.</em></p>

<p>She sounds quite chipper once she makes it to the telephone. ‘Hey dear!’ it sounds. ‘Happy Mother’s Day’, I go. A few years ago, when I decided that I was going to transition into low contact mode with my mother, I couldn’t have imagined that Mother’s Day was going to be like this.</p>

<p>As many countries celebrate moms today, we remember that, on Mother’s Day last year, we saw my stepfather leave for the hospital, never to return again. The anniversary of his death is next week. Given the trajectory of my life, celebrating my mother’s parenting abilities seems ridiculous, but given the calendar, keeping a distance between us on this very day seems cruel.</p>

<p>As the daughter of my mother, I am two individuals. I am at once the person she wants to see, the one who overcame childhood troubles to arrive in adulthood a loving and supportive daughter. Also, though, I am the adult who just graduated from over two decades of therapy, someone who is active in those corners of Reddit where people go to discuss parental emotional abuse. My attachment to both of my parents is so disturbed that close contact is not really possible.</p>

<p>I remind myself vaguely of my expat friends, the gay ones who came to Amsterdam to escape their queerphobic countries. When they talk on the phone with their parents, they have to ignore so many parts of their personality that they become other people. They don’t really have a choice.</p>

<p>And I do, at least, this much I’m told by the Catechism of the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>After all, a good Catholic is someone who honors their father and mother. Sometimes, after working myself into a frenzy thinking about this, I research Catholic teachings on the healthy and God-loving child-parent relationship. My clobber passages are not the ones about queerness. They are those verses that tell me that children who don’t provide for their parents are worse than unbelievers. That it pleases the Lord when I obey my mother in everything. I don’t experience any spiritual rewards of peace and prosperity when I honor my parents the way the Bible (or society) teaches me. I experience the opposite.</p>

<p>‘Jews have the same teachings, you know’ my favorite person will say. ‘Really?!’ ‘Yes, you… stole our book, remember?’ it will follow, jokingly but only because there’s truth in most jokes. Two things are true, she says. ‘One: biological parents aren’t the only ones doing the parenting. Take Grandma Dora, for example. You always tell me how safe and welcome you felt in her home. Now that is a parent.’ ‘And two?’, I’ll ask, hopeful. ‘Two: it’s up to you to decide what constitutes honoring your parents. Either you can decide, or you can be miserable.’</p>

<p>I’m trying.</p>

    </header>
    <html><body>
<p>It’s Gay Pride today. Yesterday, as N and I were on our way to the cinema, somebody yelled “DYKES!” at us.</p>

<p>I dislike such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia" target="_blank">antics</a> as much as the next gay. I don’t like the words “dyke” and “fag” and the stigma surrounding homosexuality. Since we’re alive in the modern world of 2009, I always fervently hope that people know better by now.</p>

<p>I’m lucky enough to live in an environment with friends and family who support me. My choice to walk hand in hand with N, and not Nicholas. I rarely encounter homophobia.</p>

<p>But then again, I don’t look like a lesbian. It’s a personal choice: I’m also Dutch, half African, an inhabitant of Eindhoven, married to reading, writing, and books, and in love with Anohni<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> from that band. If I were to express all of those identities, I might as well start wishing I turn into a float tomorrow.</p>

<p>What I’m annoyed with is the fact that yesterday, I saw 300 different stereotyped people pass me in the street, and I somehow managed to keep my mouth shut to all of them. Because I <em>do</em> care about other people’s feelings. Because we live IN THE NETHERLANDS, damnit.</p>

<p>But you know, I think about things, and I know the insecure, angry, Moroccan teenager is not to blame. After all, I’m sure he’s had a few insults hurled at him, and he was just reciprocating this civil friendliness. This experience reminds me I don’t live in a country that fully accepts the life I live. Whichever way you look at it, emancipation in the gay scene isn’t as omnipresent as we think it is.</p>

<p>Because today is the Day of Days, and some people are on their tenth sangria dancing on a boat in thong underwear, I think it’s only fitting to think about what a multicultural and diverse country such as the Netherlands is really doing.</p>

<p>Are gay people more emancipated than the San Francisco of the 70s? Or do the near-naked protests, gay gyms, gay saunas, gay stores, gay parties, gay travel agencies find ways to work against us? Is the gap between straight people and gay people bigger than we care to admit? Are we still asking whether “we” fit into “your” world and vice versa, or is there finally space to start talking about “our” world?</p>

<p>If “we” want to fit into “your” world — which I think we’ve already been doing for decades, just to the inattentiveness of some — is it smart of gay people to seclude ourselves to spaces designed for people like us? When one lesbian says “hey dyke” to another, it’s a term of endearment. But if a straight girl or, even better, a Moroccan boy, says the term casually near a gay person, we call it discrimination.</p>

<p>I’m for emancipation, and against exception.</p>

<p>That’s why I’m sitting here writing this instead of celebrating Gay Pride.</p>

<p>What do you think? I know it’s a difficult subject, but please keep it civil in the comments. Constructive criticism, please.</p>
