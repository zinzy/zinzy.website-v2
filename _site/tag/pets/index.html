    </header>
    <html><body>
<p>What I love most about today’s snapshot is the despair I can see in Lemonade’s eyes even when her entire body is a background blur. DJ is a calm 12-year-old dog, and Lemonade was thrilled to see another dog in our home for the first time, but her energy level was high enough that I eventually brought her back to her crate. It was right in time, too, because the afternoon light filling the living room made for a nice little portrait.</p>

<p>It was wonderful to welcome Yana into our home for the first time. When I hired her in the late Winter of 2022 as our newest UX designer, I knew there was something special about her. Now, well over a year later, I’m pleased to call her a friend. We caught up on career adventures, new trends in the design industry, and of course the joys of being a dog mom.</p>

<p>After Yana and DJ left, Anja and I began winding down for the day. After dinner, we watched the latest episode of the final season of <em>Succession</em>, which may have been my favorite one yet. The characters on this show are so complex and candidly-written. I’m already low-key heartbroken that this show is going to end. At the same time, I’m also pleased to be alive to watch it unfold in real time.</p>

    </header>
    <html><body>
<p>Life sure is different now that we’ve gotten Lemonade on a proper walking schedule. She still feels most comfortable going potty on the puppy pads we have on our balcony, but she absolutely loves going out and exploring the neighborhood.</p>

<p>I’m surprised by how well she walks on a loose leash, and how few issues we’ve had with the stuff she puts in her mouth. I’m hoping to make most use of her imprint period, and that means familiarizing her with as many different things as possible.</p>

<p>I’m happy to find a cat on our morning walk. Lemonade responds to the cat the way I expected a dog would: oozing deference. They stand across from each other for a few minutes, and I reward Lemonade with cheese treats afterwards.</p>

<p>It’s the first step on the road to Lemonade meeting Pookie, my mother-in-law’s cat.</p>

      <h1><a href="/2023/04/08/a-very-mathilde-visit/">A very Mathilde visit</a></h1>
    </header>
    <html><body>
<p>Much like last year, I’m so excited for Mathilde to visit our house that I get a headache just thinking about it. We’ve known each other 23 years, and, by miracle, our friendship is both acclimatized to our adult lives <em>and</em> as full of energy and curiosity as it was when we met in our first year of secondary school.</p>

<p>She comes bearing gifts: seeds for the garden, dyke poetry, David Sedaris. She knows what I like. We eat, this time around I’ve kept it simple with dishes from the traiteur and not ten separate homemade recipes of intricate delicacies. We talk about what teaching means to her and Anja. We play with Lemonade.</p>

<p>As a friend, Mathilde is very easy to love. Our times together eventually always bring us back to our shared emotional outlet: making music. “I’m nervous to sing around you, Zinzy” she says, but her voice sounds beautiful, warm, and exactly what my piano calls for. When I think of “blue-eyed soul” I think of Mathilde’s voice. We tell each other Anja and I will make it down south this year, and we’ll go for côte de bœuf in Maastricht. I can’t wait.</p>

      <h1><a href="/2023/03/26/week-11/">Week 11: Meeting Patrick</a></h1>
    </header>
    <html><body>
<ul>
  <li>I got to meet one of my Internet heroes this week: <a href="patrickrhone.com" target="_blank">Patrick Rhone</a> and his family were on a Europe trip, and I was lucky enough <a href="https://www.patrickrhone.net/13189-2/" target="_blank">to catch the planning stage on his blog</a> right in time to extend an invitation. We spent a rainy Monday evening in de Jordaan at <a href="http://www.cafedetuin.nl/" target="_blank">Cafe de Tuin</a>, talking ye olde Internet productivity culture, the arts, politics, hopes and dreams, and how his teenage daughter apparently woke up one night singing “raise a glass to freedom”. Fine people, they are.</li>
  <li>After another week with Lemonade, I’m beginning to feel more confident about raising her to be a well-behaved, confident puppy. For the most part, she’s doing very well. The only real challenge we have is the barking to which she’ll resort every time she’s in the crate but not sleeping. Through trial and error, we’re slowly learning how to help her settle down more easily, and this week, the efforts have begun to pay off.</li>
  <li>I’ve got some exciting news forthcoming that isn’t quite ready for the public just yet, but it has managed to lift my spirits greatly. I’ll be able to write more in the next few weeks, but for now it’s safe to say I’m feeling hopeful, inspired, and ready.</li>
  <li>While Anja had apparently been around to watch season one when it was released, I’ve only now turned onto the wonderful journey that is <em>Abbott Elementary</em>. I would never actually ask the universe for a reboot of <em>The Office: US</em>, but this new mockumentary revolving around a poorly-managed, underfunded Philadelphia public school has exactly the vibe I would’ve hoped to get from that nonexistent reboot. It’s just nice that, with this show, Black people are at the front and center.</li>
  <li>Spring has officially begun, but as one of the regulars at my coffee place said: “the question isn’t when spring begins but when  rain ends”. It seems the weather’s getting better, though, and I can feel I’m on the cusp of storing away my winter coat. It has been a long time coming.</li>

      <h1><a href="/2023/03/12/week-10/">Week 10: Outings</a></h1>
    </header>
    <html><body>
<ul>
  <li>It snowed a few times this week and I was as baffled as I always am to see it happening in March. I don’t have a great understanding of what the weather’s supposed to do in a given period of the year.</li>
  <li>After two weeks of cocooning, we’ve finally been taking Lemonade out to various places. I aim to take her out at least once a day, usually to the park or a walk around the block. We also visited my favorite coffee place twice. It’s wonderful to see she’s such a relaxed and curious dog.</li>
  <li>This was my last full week off. I still have a few days left and then I head back into work. I don’t know how people work after they first got a puppy, and I’m grateful I was able to take this time off.</li>
  <li>I attended service at All Saints again. It was an intimate gathering with a rather inspiring reflection comparing “giving up” to “letting go” for Lent. I feel like I never get Lent right: I drop in too late, don’t see it all the way through, and this always makes me feel like I’m not a proper Christian. Regardless, it’s great to become acquainted with All Saints. Its focus on inclusivity gives me goosebumps.</li>
  <li>Lemonade met the other corgi in the building, Lalo. At only ten weeks older than she is, he towered over her as they played, but she didn’t let that bother her. He was so sweet playing with her, using his strength in a very gentle way. Here’s to hoping they’ll become best friends.</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://anneliewambeek.com" target="_blank">Annelie</a> came over for tea and lemon punitions. She had been gone for a few weeks and I had missed her. She’s Lemonade’s godmother, and as they met in real life for the first time it was clear to see why this is so.</li>
  <li>Anja started her ceramics course at Studio Pansa. On Sunday she had her second class, and she took pictures. She’s such a fast learner, and the pots she made came out beautifully. I’m proud of her.</li>

    <html><body>
<p>Lemonade, Lemonade, Lemonade. Who knew I would ever become a dog person? Two weeks ago, we picked up our corgi Lemonade Zelda Loulé. There was a torrent of research both Anja and I did to prepare for this puppy. There was a birth announcement card. A <a href="https://www.anneliewambeek.com/" target="_blank">godmother</a> was appointed. Here are some things I learned after two weeks with a dog.</p>

<h3 id="the-roi-of-good-research">The ROI of good research</h3>
<p>Anja and I are both blessed with a-type personalities and a propensity for thorough investigation. Early on in our dog prep journey, we found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@McCannDogs" target="_blank">McCann Dogs</a>, a training school with a YouTube channel full of clear, concise, and highly-informative videos on how to raise a puppy.</p>

<p>Two weeks in, I can tell they taught us well. Lemonade hasn’t had an accident in the house since day three, she sleeps through the night aside from two or three potty breaks, and it’s great to see how quickly she’s picking up commands. A week before Lemonade arrived, we started on McCann’s course <a href="https://mydogcan.mccanndogs.com/courses/puppy-essentials" target="_blank">Puppy Essentials</a>, which has proven a great way to get through the first few weeks.</p>

<h3 id="i-got-cabin-fever">I got cabin fever</h3>
<p>Out of all the things I had anticipated in preparing for this puppy, cabin fever was not one of them. While Anja and I are both quite introverted (meaning we need to recharge whenever we’ve been around people), she seemed fine spending her spring break cocooning in the house. I, on the other hand, felt myself slowly going mad over the lack of stimulus I was getting.</p>

<p>Because of our potty training schedule, and lack of a big garden, I barely got out of the house the first week. Luckily, I quickly developed the habit of taking Lemonade out on walks, even if we didn’t actually let her <em>walk</em> just yet because of her exposure to possible diseases. It’s great to be out of the house again, go to my favorite coffee spot, and walk around the park with her.</p>

<h3 id="the-beauty-of-trust">The beauty of trust</h3>
<p>Aside from an outdoor rabbit, a bird, a chameleon, and a shy cat, I never had any cuddly pets. Being child-free on top of that never gave me the opportunity to closely bond with another small being who trusts me enough that they’ll fall asleep on my body. Lemonade is very cuddly, and it’s entirely humbling to experience the trust she seems to have in me.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h3>
<p>I’m excited to enroll her in puppy training a few weeks from now. For the time being, she’s hanging out with trusted pets in the neighborhood, and getting to know many visitors. Looking ahead, I’m also pumped about finally taking her to the park and playing fetch with her.</p>

    </header>
    <html><body>
<p>My attempt to lure both Anja and myself outside for some fresh air and a walk was thwarted as soon as I learned the place was out of my favorite bubble tea. We strolled to Flevopark, in my hand an ice cream cone, and on my face the disappointment of a toddler who can’t be satisfied.</p>

<p>The park has a wide field that allows loose dogs to roam freely in the off-season. Even through the trees Anja and I spotted the corgi from half a mile away.</p>

<p>“I mean, we could just go up and chat a little, right? She might have some good tips?” Anja and I wondered, looking for an excuse to get closer to the dog. We must have looked completely adorable, because the face of Kenny’s owner brightened once she noticed us lingering nearby.</p>

<p>She told us about their routine, how he could already stay home alone for most of the day, and how she’d had never heard him bark. Within minutes we learned we all know Lalo, another corgi in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>It’s nice getting to know this new corner of the neighborhood. She and I are dog people now.</p>

    <html><body>
<p>Have you heard? Anja and I are getting a dog. It was up in the air for a little while, but we got the confirmation yesterday that we’ll get first pick of a nest of eight adorable little Pembroke - Cardigan corgi mixes. We’re meeting the puppies for the first time on Sunday. Are you crying? I’m crying.</p>

<p><a href="/2022/12/30/2022-in-review/" target="_blank">2022 showed me</a> that there are serious drawbacks to being an A type personality. The way it helps Anja and I prepare for a puppy isn’t one of them. Too excited to sleep, I now <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@zinzy/109674435586703598" target="_blank">wake at 04:15</a> to formulate schedules, training OKRs, and crate strategies.</p>

<p>Annoyingly, I’ve now become one of those people who thinks they know a minuscule sliver of the dread expecting parents must feel, aiming to read all of the world’s parenting books before retiring on the idea that, at the end of the day, it’s all about intuition and consistency.</p>
