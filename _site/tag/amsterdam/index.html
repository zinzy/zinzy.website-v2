<p>She blesses Anja, me, and a handful of other people who carved out time in their Sunday evenings to come to Church. I have never been inside this particular church building before, and chuckle at how <em>new</em> the Old Catholic decor is: in imagery and candle lighting possibilities it’s reminiscent of the average Dutch Roman Catholic church. Its white walls and central heating tell me something different.</p>

<p>You may think I chose this church because the woman blessing us is Desmond Tutu’s daughter, the Reverend Canon Mpho Tutu van Furth, and because Anja and I can’t help but fangirl. I’m here because she’s a Black queer person leading a church service that I can attend in person. I never thought I would see the day.</p>

<p>Dare I wonder whether I have found a new church in <a href="https://allsaintsamsterdam.com/" target="_blank">All Saints Amsterdam</a>?</p>

      <h2><a href="/2023/01/23/why-doesnt-the-crosswalk-work/">Why doesn't the crosswalk work?</a></h2>
    </header>
    <html><body>
<p>There’s a woman who runs a <a href="https://www.athenaeum.nl/winkels/zuidoost" target="_blank">bookshop in De Bijlmer</a>. She has kind eyes that make you want to curl up with a book and a cup of tea. Often when I’m there, she offers just that: tea, and a place to quiet down and dive into an interesting title. She’s running a fine business over there, Cole Verhoeven is.</p>

<p>Aside from bookshop owner she’s also a writer. I love the work she does at <a href="https://www.oneworld.nl/" target="_blank">One World</a>, where she articulates <a href="https://www.oneworld.nl/lezen/opinie/witte-fragiliteit-bestaat-niet/" target="_blank">strong perspectives</a> <a href="https://www.oneworld.nl/lezen/discriminatie/sociaal-onrecht/woke-ooit-een-waarschuwing-voor-racisme-nu-een-conservatief-hondenfluitje/" target="_blank">on antiracism</a> <a href="https://www.oneworld.nl/lezen/opinie/kamala-harris-is-niet-de-eerste-geschikte-zwarte-vrouw/" target="_blank">and equity</a>. A few weeks ago, she sold me this book:</p>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbi2zounq/image/upload/c_scale,w_1200/v1674660345/zinzy.website/IMG_9581_iaat6s.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>When I took it from the shelf, I didn’t know she was the one who wrote it. Eventually, she told me she had drawn inspiration from the questions her child asks her. The questions often leave her bemused, surprised, stunned. I suppose they’re the questions we forget to ask as we grow older.</p>

<p>It’s a perfect coffee table book, deserving of a central place in the house to welcome guests into an atmosphere of curiosity and whimsy.</p>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dbi2zounq/image/upload/c_scale,w_1200/v1674660350/zinzy.website/FullSizeRender_2_yv2nim.jpg" alt="Page of the book &quot;Why doesn't the crosswalk work?&quot;m with on the left, in Dutch and English, the question &quot;why are all the garbage men brown?&quot;"></p>

<p>One page that stands out to me is this one. There must have been countless times I wondered similar things as a child. Why are the garbage men brown? Why do all the other colored people live on the other side of the tracks? Why don’t I see myself on television?</p>

<p>I imagine the life of Cole’s child, growing up in this part of history, with a Black parent at home to raise him, in one of the most diverse cities in Europe. Access to a Black-owned bookshop that helps people see themselves in others. It makes me feel equal parts envy and calm.</p>

    </header>
    <html><body>
<p>My attempt to lure both Anja and myself outside for some fresh air and a walk was thwarted as soon as I learned the place was out of my favorite bubble tea. We strolled to Flevopark, in my hand an ice cream cone, and on my face the disappointment of a toddler who can’t be satisfied.</p>

<p>The park has a wide field that allows loose dogs to roam freely in the off-season. Even through the trees Anja and I spotted the corgi from half a mile away.</p>

<p>“I mean, we could just go up and chat a little, right? She might have some good tips?” Anja and I wondered, looking for an excuse to get closer to the dog. We must have looked completely adorable, because the face of Kenny’s owner brightened once she noticed us lingering nearby.</p>

<p>She told us about their routine, how he could already stay home alone for most of the day, and how she’d had never heard him bark. Within minutes we learned we all know Lalo, another corgi in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>It’s nice getting to know this new corner of the neighborhood. She and I are dog people now.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2022/04/02/week-13/">Week 13: Recruiting</a></h2>
    </header>
    <html><body>
<p>It has been snowing in Amsterdam. As the years go by, I’m having trouble understanding whether I’m experiencing the effects of global warming, or whether I’ve never paid attention to what was always in front of me until now. It is likely a combination of the two. Either way, it is sad to see Amsterdammers retreat into their homes after two weeks of shorts and drinks in the sun.</p>

<h3 id="at-work">At work</h3>
<p>Leeruniek’s Product team is hiring, and I’ve been the one taking care of the recruitment process for two engineering and one design role. So far, I’ve found a new front-end engineer as well as a designer within two months, so I suppose you could say I’ve been busy. If this process has been teaching me anything new, it’s that 1) I very much enjoy meeting people and learning about their (work) life stories, 2) there is such value in building strong relationships with recruiters who make you smile, and 3) it takes two weeks of introdutory chats before I begin to regret having to listen to my own voice give the same pitch over and over again.</p>

<h3 id="at-home">At home</h3>
<p>Another secret blessing of Covid has been the ability to spend more time at home, which, for me, immediately translates to the ability to better consider how I value my home environment. We’ve been churning through a pretty long list of home improvement projects, the absolute highlight so far having been installing a projector and theatre screen in the living room. Last weekend, we finished most of the work on our kitchen remodelling by putting in new counter tops.</p>

<h3 id="cooking">Cooking</h3>
<p>A while ago, we found some new recipes that we’ve enjoyed refining:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://alexandracooks.com/2016/04/25/tartines-quiche-potato-crusted/" target="_blank">Tartine’s Quiche, Potato Crusted</a> by Alexandra Stafford, which is great in itself but will be even better with a thicker crust</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://alexandracooks.com/2019/05/17/spring-fattoush-salad/" target="_blank">Spring Fattoush Salad</a>, also by Alexandra Stafford, which is quite likely the best salad I’ve ever had. I’ve had it with Namiko Hirasawa Chen’s <a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/teriyaki-salmon-recipe/" target="_blank">teriyaki salmon</a> and it is simply divine.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="watching">Watching</h3>
<p>I’ve been watching a lot of Dutch documentaries on the effects Internet culture has on children. <a href="https://www.2doc.nl/documentaires/collecties/themas/toekomst/internet.html" target="_blank">2doc</a> has a selection. I particularly enjoyed <em>My Daughter, the Vlogger</em>. I can’t imagine what it’s like to raise a child, and I can’t imagine what it would be like in 2022. Still, “all her peers will have a YouTube channel by the time they are six, she might as well get a leg up” sounds sad coming out of the mouth of a 3-year-old’s mother.</p>

<h3 id="listening">Listening</h3>
<p>I’ve been playing Heardle and loving it.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2022/03/26/week-12/">Week 12: Bonsoihoir</a></h2>
    </header>
    <html><body>
<p>The tourists are back in town. Lots of Germans with face masks. I suppose we’re all beginning to venture out into the world again, just a bit closer to home. Anja and I are considering taking the ferry to Norway. Apparently you can camp virtually anywhere in that country, as long as you “leave it cleaner than you found it” and make sure you’re gone after two days. At this point, we’re vastly underestimating how attached we are to luxury. I can still hear myself whining “Bonsoihoir”. This was the catch-all name we used anyone who would come to the door of our Parisian hotel room with a bucket of ice, “no, not for champagne, just for the drinks”. I also really don’t like ticks, and I simply can’t imagine that Norway somehow doesn’t have the national health crisis taunting its neighbor.</p>

<p>We’ve begun hosting dinner parties again. <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022421-bulgogi-eggplant" target="_blank">Eggplant bulgogi</a> and <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/2020/01/roasted-squash-and-tofu-with-ginger/" target="_blank">roasted squash with soy-glazed gingery tofu</a> make for a great Asian fusion. With a side of steamed rice and homemade furikake, of course. I also seem to be making improvements with the dough I typically use to make challah and jam buns. The buns came out spectacularly well and were fluffy and delicious even without having been covered during the refrigerator proofing.</p>

<p>At work, I’m preparing for our new designer to join the team. Practically, this means cleaning up our documentation and our design system so that she has a place to land rather than a hot mess. I’m being more verbose than I normally am in my design documentation, and having to write about my decisions makes me notice all the techniques and frameworks I’ve come to use over the years. One of my favorite’s is Cohesive design, which is now so second nature that I forgot I didn’t even think of it myself.</p>

<p>On Sunday I watched a few horror films, <em>Midsommar</em> being the favorite. I also watched <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> (2022), which wasn’t even that bad until I got to the final scene. Anja and I are watching season 4 of <em>Killing Eve</em>, which I imagine and hope will be the last season. Assassin résumé aside, I get Villanelle. I get every little bit of her.</p>

    </header>
    <html><body>
<p>I never get much reading done unless I’m sleeping elsewhere. Most often, I associate sleeping elsewhere with having time off, and having time off means I’m away from a computer screen. This frees up time for reading.</p>

<p>A had booked a suite for my birthday at Okura, and six months after I turn 33, Covid measures are finally so mild that we actually get to do it. It’s on the sixteenth floor, overlooking the Amsterdam Centre and West Side. We eat like royalty, and fall asleep watching the sunset from our California King. I’m feeling like a million bucks.</p>

<p>Whenever we sleep elsewhere, I get overwhelmed with the endless possibilities of the things I can read. Usually, I manage to sneak five books into a suitcase, but for this weekend, I’ve limited myself to one: <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/42452986" target="_blank">Mary Magdalene Revealed</a></em>.</p>

<p>It’s a remarkable read, particularly given that the author Meggan Watterson got an MDiv and not an MFA in writing. Her words flow like a river, entirely sure of where she’s going. Every now and then, I’ll read a portion aloud to A, to share the joy of reading a theological work that is as inclusive and self-aware as it is unreserved and educational.</p>

<p>As I share snippets of insights, revelations in sweat lodges as well as things I never knew about the beauty of early Christianity, A asks me: “Don’t you find this book a bit… <em>The Da Vinci Code</em>-esque? I mean, all this talk of Mary Magdalene’s special relationship with Jesus, alternative plot lines… It’s like it’s all one big conspiracy theory, wouldn’t you say?”</p>

<p>A’s not the only woman who has made such remarks about this book. Isn’t it peculiar that feminists would rather deem femininity-inclusive gospels closer to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1400331" target="_blank">possibly the worst book in the English language that has emerged in the past decade</a> than to a perspective on Christ that could cure our heartaches?</p>

<p>Her Summer break started yesterday, and as always it is an event. I am so excited about getting everything right that I mostly present as a frantic killjoy. <em>Jeopardy</em> makes everything better.</p>

<p>I start today with my usual bike route past the bakeries. Niemeijer for pain au choc and canelés, followed by tiger buns and krentenbollen at <a href="https://simonmeijssen.nl/" target="_blank">Simon Meijssen</a>. Niemeijer won best croissant of Amsterdam, but I think they’re too bready.</p>

<p>In the window of Meijssen they’re showcasing pride muffins. Neither of us likes muffins, but I buy two anyway. They’re surprisingly good.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2021/01/17/week-2/">Week 2: Home office</a></h2>
    </header>
    <html><body>
<p>I’m terrible at keeping it a secret: my favorite time in the week is when A works from home. We spent the past month building a home office in a one-bedroom apartment, and I’m happy about the result. Monday is Uni day for her. I find it endearing that her Statistics course is throwing her for a loop a little bit.</p>

<p>“Work is so great!” I think to myself on Tuesday. My onboarding period is somewhat odd because of two separate parental leaves in my team. Now that my fellow designer is back again, I have to conclude that she is an utter blast. A attempts to use her iPad as a sidecar but doesn’t get the audio right. This makes it so that I can hear all of her pupils wrestle through <em>1984</em>. When she discusses a particular rainy scene, a girl says “like, I don’t know, it’s, like, just typically English”, and we both smile.</p>

<p>After work on Wednesday, I take a bike ride on A’s super fast ebike and almost run over a young woman in Vondelpark. Running after dusk without lights should be prohibited. I bike for miles and get lost a couple times, one of the perks of living in a large city like Amsterdam I call that. I plan to go to bed early, but find myself drifting in and out as we watch the second impeachment of Trump until past midnight instead.</p>

<p>On Thursday, my <a href="/now" target="_blank">Now</a> page is published on <a href="https://nownownow.com/p/Tptv" target="_blank">nownownow.com</a>. After a beautiful day at the home office, I’m excited to play around with the Apple Watch I got in the mail when my mother calls me at 9 p.m. On speaker phone, she pours a wide variety of complaints into the room, and I tell her I don’t need her parentification<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. It’s no use expecting that she will remember what I say three months from now, so I tell her the truth.</p>

<p>I accidentally have myself a total Miracle Morning on Friday: I meditate on kindness, I take a walk in the neighborhood, and update my finances. We hate-watch the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13649692/" target="_blank"><em>Surviving Death</em></a> episodes on mediums. A tells me she’s been to more than one seance in her life. I wish there was a separate TV channel just for medium weekend retreats.</p>

<p>On Saturday, at 990 days of sobriety, I sign up for a queer-friendly AA meeting. Not drinking is easy, but I haven’t begun to connect my alcohol abuse to the rest of my life, and it makes me feel weird. I spend the better part of the day tinkering with my personal site.</p>
