The living room looks so much more spacious this way. I’m wearing my favorite jeans, and my hair is demonstrably longer than it has been in recent years. I call this combed-out afro The Microphone.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"existing\">Existing</h3>\n<p>In Amsterdam’s finest neighborhood, de Indische Buurt, I’m watching the autumn set in, and I’m loving every minute of it. Apart from the scorching hot first week of September, everything about the weather tells me it’s time for <em>hygge, hygge, hygge</em>. Anja’s back in school, which means I’m settling back into a more structured hybrid work method. Wednesdays I spend at the office, and the other days I start off at home, and join my coworkers on-site on most afternoons. I love this, and the structure of it all is doing me good. Lemonade has entered puberty.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"enjoying\">Enjoying</h3>\n<p>Unlike what I had planned, I barely spent any time in the pool this summer. What I did continue to develop is my <span title=\"This points to a note, but it is private\" class=\"invalid-link\">  <span class=\"invalid-link-brackets\"></span>  Yin yoga  <span class=\"invalid-link-brackets\"></span></span> practice, alongside a practice of guided and unguided meditation. To decompress in the mornings and evenings, piano practice remains a close friend. I’m not making the progress I want to be making, but composition and singing help me regulate emotions stunningly well. Lastly, I’m fond of the writing practice I’ve established. I publish on this website, write in my diary, and correspond via snail mail with a few friends. Also, I fantasize about trying my very first pumpkin spiced latte.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"community\">Community</h3>\n<p>I feel fortunate to be engaged in a number of communities where I meet people in which I can see myself. A few months ago, I discovered <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"/bar-bario\">Bar Bario</a>, a place by and for queer people of color. In addition, I’m enjoying watching the community grow at <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"/2023/02/12/all-saints-amsterdam\">All Saints Amsterdam</a>, where I’ve joined the team as website person. In the margins of my thoughts, I’m slowly putting together what the future of <span title=\"This points to a note, but it is private\" class=\"invalid-link\">  <span class=\"invalid-link-brackets\"></span>  Queer Salon  <span class=\"invalid-link-brackets\"></span></span> will be.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"working\">Working</h3>\n<p>I’m approaching six months at healthcare technology scaleup <span title=\"This points to a note, but it is private\" class=\"invalid-link\">  <span class=\"invalid-link-brackets\"></span>  Gerimedica  <span class=\"invalid-link-brackets\"></span></span>, where I’m a senior-but-silly researcher and designer. The term <em>senior-but-silly</em> is growing on me, because it helps me be humbly confident, and open to the whimsy’s of working with other people for a common good. I’m impressed by the company Gerimedica has become, and I am even more excited about their current challenges than I was when I began. Some questions I ask myself as part of my daily work are: how can designers facilitate developers? How do I foster user-centered curiosity among domain experts? How do we organize a UX research repository in a strict GDPR environment?</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"learning\">Learning</h3>\n<p>Through trial and error, I <a href=\"/2023/05/31/now/\">continue</a> to find ways to be my best self, both at home and at work. Acknowledging the physical and mental realities of my life, I’ve been learning a lot about <span title=\"This points to a note, but it is private\" class=\"invalid-link\">  <span class=\"invalid-link-brackets\"></span>  Neurodivergence in the workplace  <span class=\"invalid-link-brackets\"></span></span>, about the <span title=\"This points to a note, but it is private\" class=\"invalid-link\">  <span class=\"invalid-link-brackets\"></span>  Polyvagal theory  <span class=\"invalid-link-brackets\"></span></span>, and about a holistic, trauma-informed understanding of mental health. Practically, the books <em><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25404196-the-smart-but-scattered-guide-to-success\">The Smart but Scattered Guide to Success</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44285784-divergent-mind?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=totomZ1WpA&amp;rank=1\">Divergent Mind</a></em>, and <em><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4912918-living-with-intensity\">Living with Intensity</a></em>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@elizabethfilips\">Elizabeth Filips</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@CrappyChildhoodFairy\">the Crappy Childhood Fairy</a> have been sources of inspiration.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"reading-watching-listening\">Reading, watching, listening</h3>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3867.The_History_of_Love\">The History of Love</a></em> takes my breath away, as did <em><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5687612/\">Fleabag</a></em>.</p>",

            "content_html": "<ul>\n  <li>Cooler temperatures! After the hottest week I’ve experienced in months, things were back to comfortable Summer weather. By the time I’m writing this the sky is gray and it’s raining, but this week’s weather was cheerful and moderate.</li>\n  <li>On Tuesday and Wednesday I gave two big UX workshops at week to help coworkers understand how they can use UX in their daily work. I’ve been giving workshops for well over a decade, always trusting my instinct to figure out what a particular group or context required. At work, though, we have two wonderful scrum masters who are well-versed in the art of facilitation. I learned a <em>lot</em> from their feedback, and saw a hugh jump between the quality of the first day and of the second day.</li>\n  <li>I caught up with a special friend on Wednesday, a young woman I met because we were treated for the same health condition. Her life as a Psych major couldn’t be more different from mine, and yet the red threads our lives resemble one another. I’m fortunate to call her my friend.</li>\n  <li>I had missed a few weeks in my RSS reader, but I was pleased to see Manuel Moreale’s <em><a href=\"https://manuelmoreale.com/\">People &amp; Blogs</a></em> is off to a good start. To hell with Anja calling me a geek for being into the IndieWeb, I love visiting other people’s websites. I suspect I love reading what they have to say about those websites even more.</li>\n  <li>Last week, I had met an amazing couple of lesbians who invited me over for a casual dinner party on Friday. After a particularly challenging week, it was comforting to hear their experiences as people of color in the world today. I’m already looking forward to inviting them to our place.</li>\n  <li>On Saturday, Anja and I kicked off the weekend with a spontaneous redesign of our living room. We finally got rid of my desk, which was a Covid-era purchase used for our home office. What remains now is Anja’s bigger desk, which functions as a dining room table that she hates more than I do. The removal of our home office allowed us to place our sofa there, which has giving the living room a significant amount of extra space. The dining room table continues to double as an office whenever we put our ultrawide monitor there. I like <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"/modular-living\">modular living</a>, and I’m feeling less and less awkward about the way we’re going about it in our house.</li>\n  <li>At the end of our cleaning sprint Anja mentioned it was a beautiful day for this accomplishment, since it was Rosh Hashanah. New living room, new beginnings.</li>\n  <li>After visiting Anja’s mom in the afternoon, we biked to Kriterion to Watch <span title=\"This points to a note, but it is private\" class=\"invalid-link\">  <span class=\"invalid-link-brackets\"></span>  Oppenheimer (2023)  <span class=\"invalid-link-brackets\"></span></span>.</li>\n  <li>Much like the last few days, I’m not in the best of states. There’s an old sadness that keeps saying hello, and I’m slowly beginning to think it might be time to get some help with it.</li>\n  <li>I’m nearing the end of my journal, and I’m surprised by how unnervous I am by the few pages I have left. In this past, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/7/12/20680004/notebook-journal-finish-strategies\">like the rest of the world, as it appears</a>, I had trouble finishing a journal in a relaxed manner. Looking at the first entry, I see I have 29 days left until it’ll have been one year exactly. Hello nerves.</li>\n</ul>",

Getting out of a hot shower and feeling equally wet fifteen minutes later. Lemonade barely wanting to walk outside. The sun beaming so feriously we can’t keep the windows open. Thank you, Jesus, but please make it cooler.</li>\n  <li>There’s something sweet about seeing Amsterdam through the eyes of friends from abroad. On Tuesday, I couldn’t have been more excited to welcome my <a href=\"https://vineandfig.co/\">Vine &amp; Fig friends</a> Pickles and Patrick to the city. They’re two Irish Catholic gay men named Patrick, so we try to make it work any way we can.</li>\n  <li>I was saddened by the fact that Jacob, Patrick’s husband, couldn’t make it because he had to stay home and help their dog Jude recover from surgery. All week, I felt like we were missing a limb.</li>\n  <li>I joined the V&amp;F leadership team in mid 2020, and we’ve been growing a friendship since. The moment I saw them I knew we were going to get along perfectly in real life, too. Finally getting to embrace them felt like to most natural thing in the world.</li>\n  <li>Their AirBnb, which is located just off of Vijzelgracht, was absolutely ridiculous. A three-bedroom penthouse overlooking De Pijp, enormous backyard below, include Swedish saunas and swimming pools. This is how the other half lives.</li>\n  <li>I made time to hang out with the Patricks every day they were here, which took us to sweet places. I took them to <a href=\"https://takeichi-ramen.eu/\">Takeichi</a>, my favorite ramen place where I always order anything but ramen, and to <a href=\"https://studio-k.nu/\">Studio K</a>, where they met Lemonade, who chewed through her leash in what seemed like a quiet moment.</li>\n  <li>On Friday, we went cheese and wine tasting at <a href=\"https://abrahamkef.nl/vestigingen/proeflokaal/\">Abraham Kef in Noord</a>. It reminded me of how much I love cheese. It was the first thing I was able to say after I learned to say “momma”. I want to make my own cheese.</li>\n  <li>After dinner at <a href=\"https://thuskomme.nl/\">Thuskomme</a> on Saturday we took silly mugshots with my Polaroid camera.</li>\n  <li>It is truly wonderful to spend time with the Patricks, with whom I weave in and out of conversation topics like it’s nobody’s business. One minute we’re talking about sex toys, and the next about the Book of Job. Knowing they were going to be leaving made me cry a little bit, but then I remembered our friendship had survived without physical get-togethers for three years already.</li>\n  <li>On Friday, I met with Mpho to chat church business. I’ve been discerning all Summer about how I would want to be involved in the church now that it’s becoming a church plant, and I decided maintaining the website and social media was a commitment I could make.</li>\n  <li>On Sunday, All Saints held her homecoming gathering after the Summer break. Kyle Rader, our new minister, was there for the first time. I liked the elder millennial vibe he brings to the service. It was intimate and lovely, although I seriously missed the pianist. After the service, we gathered for a potluck dinner in the bishop’s garden next to the church. I showed the logo ideas I had been working on, to friendly compliments.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbi2zounq/image/upload/v1694936600/IMG_5896_clkzw4.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbi2zounq/image/upload/v1694936602/FullSizeRender_2_mznjqq.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbi2zounq/image/upload/v1694936600/FullSizeRender_fgwrwq.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>I saw a guy on Monday that I went on a date with once. It was one of those whimsical dates. We had fish by the sea. It felt like coming home a little bit. I think the world was trying to introduce me to something for which I wasn’t ready yet. Looking back, that date, more than the others, prepared me for Anja. Looking back through butterfly effect glasses, it might as well have been him.</p>\n\n<p>Yesterday wasn’t a great day. They say recovery is a habit and it is. I was feeling quite low about myself. One hour at my friend’s citizenship party and I’d call it a night. Tomorrow would be full of things, too. Then he arrived. Like an old friend entering the scene.</p>\n\n<p>As soon as I head over, we hug, and he begins telling me that he talks about me when he’s teaching storytelling, on an almost weekly basis, eight years on. “It’s when I begin to talk about tension-building” he says, and I laugh loudly, after which he eyebrows “you know what moment I’m talking about, right?” I say yes but I don’t. Back then, I was too drunk to really remember anything with accuracy.</p>\n\n<p>He turns towards to his friends and continues. “I lean in to kiss her, but she rejects me. And I’m so nervous, thinking ‘gosh, did I really misread all the signs?!’” Apparently, then I said these words, which…:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Wait. This is the last moment that you and I have never kissed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As he was telling this story, my entire body lit up. Partially turned on, but predominantly struck with delight. Who is that person? Can I have her number? Oh hold on, he’s talking about me.</p>\n\n<p>Two things can be true at once, and for a moment, my experience of myself felt finely in balance. The universe can hold me as the asshole I see in myself, but also as the person whose butterfly wings can make a small change.</p>\n\n<p>I spent the rest of the evening meeting kind strangers. White cis gay men who wanted to join the queer meetup I run, where my friend and I met. Kinfolk, effortlessly introduced as we blew <span title=\"This points to a note, but it is private\" class=\"invalid-link\">  <span class=\"invalid-link-brackets\"></span>  Cat whisper  <span class=\"invalid-link-brackets\"></span></span>s at each other.</p>\n\n<p>My friend looked stunning. An impeccable sense of style, a smile larger than the world, a citizenship bigger than we’d ever ask of him. I knew he was suspended mid-air in all sorts of areas of his life, but, looking at him, I suspected he had arrived somewhere long before any of us ever would.</p>\n\n<p>Today, grabbing coffee in the neighborhood, I meet an acquaintance who’s on sabbatical until the end of the year, spending his time taking action lessons, storytelling workshops.  I ask him if he has ever heard of the girl who almost rejected a kiss by the sea and he bursts out laughing.</p>",

Secretly hoarding our trash to avoid a reprimanding from our AirBnb host as he hovers over his six-compartment recycling bin, we continue our trip from rural Sweden to Copenhagen looking for a public recycling station.</p>\n\n<p>“Imagine if we got so nervous about doing it wrong that we ended up just dumping these bags by the roadside” I say to Anja.</p>\n\n<p>“Last Tuesday, two Dutch lesbians were found dead just outside of Lidköping after the Swedish environmental police task force shot them at point-blank range for abusing the recycling system. Their families have been notified, begrudgingly.” Anja jokes, staring off into the distance.</p>\n\n<p>“Not <em>Queen &amp; Slim</em>, but King &amp; Thicc!”, I suggest, “You can be King”.</p>\n\n<p>“But I’m thicc, too”, Anja complains.</p>\n\n<p>By now, we’re home again, back from our first proper vacation in four years, and boy oh boy, did we need it.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbi2zounq/image/upload/c_scale,h_1400/v1692260665/IMG_5143_zgqdss.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Our plan was simple: make Anja’s dream come true by renting a Tesla, drive it to Norway, do nothing there for a week, and then spend another week slowly making our way back via the Swedish countryside, and Copenhagen, where our friends live.</p>\n\n<p>After two long, well-airconditioned days in our wonderful car we made it to Eastern Norway. In Hallingdal, one of the country’s most popular ski destinations, we found a beautiful and cozy cabin on top of a mountain, overlooking the Tisleifjorden. To our surprise, it proved the perfect getaway for people who didn’t really want to… <em>do</em> anything.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbi2zounq/image/upload/c_scale,w_1400/v1692260664/IMG_4771_w0rdef.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbi2zounq/image/upload/c_scale,w_1400/v1692260657/IMG_4764_wegskx.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>It’s indeed exquisite, the Norwegian faith in our human ability to treat nature with respect. Quietly, it makes an enormous difference. The difference is in the shared understanding of where we leave our trash. It’s in the thousands of cabins spread out across the country, <a href=\"https://english.dnt.no/\">where travellers can stay for next to nothing</a>. It’s in the fire wood left behind in the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/golsfjelletvest/posts/pfbid021q9V7g4XeKd5Wz3QfEbxmsBHWVYmEHEb9mqBT4mn1F34SUCe8LoafcfE6fE61pQBl?locale=nl_NL\">freely-accessible <em>grillhytte</em></a>. It’s in the canoe that just lays by the water, available to anyone.</p>\n\n<p>“You don’t even really have to lock your doors”, one fisherman commented while teaching his son to throw a line.</p>\n\n<p>We never kept our doors unlocked, of course. The city is embedded in our system too deeply, as were the countless “cabin in the woods” movie plots I remembered. If anything, though, it helped us pause, listen to the sound of nothing, and listen to our bodies, which were telling us to take that second nap of the day.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbi2zounq/image/upload/c_scale,h_1400/v1692260657/FullSizeRender_6_wlkfj3.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbi2zounq/image/upload/c_scale,w_1400/v1692260666/IMG_4778_fm3g1i.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbi2zounq/image/upload/c_scale,h_1400/v1692260656/FullSizeRender_1_ci1pqv.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>On Sunday, one day earlier than intended, we swiftly packed the car and drove all night to Lidköping, by Vänern, Sweden’s largest lake. While we’d been napping and relaxing, the world was reading the headlines about Storm Hans, a twice-a-century type of storm that would’ve gotten us stuck on that mountain if we hadn’t left when we did. That three hours of driving through landslide-prone mountains wasn’t going to be pleasant, even in a well-heated Tesla.</p>\n\n<p>The clouds were low as we drove off.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbi2zounq/image/upload/c_scale,w_1400/v1692260661/IMG_5247_q6xbsb.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>Copenhagen, <em>kubnhawn</em> for the in-crowd, was a lot lighter, sunnier, and safer. We stayed with Naomi, Shlomik and little Goldie. Their cute, young family, the house, and the fact that were surrounded by thousands of people everywhere we went, was everything I needed after the quiet Norwegian fjords. One day exploring the city was enough to convince me: I need to visit again.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbi2zounq/image/upload/c_scale,w_1400/v1692260654/IMG_5556_zetoqz.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbi2zounq/image/upload/c_scale,h_1400/v1692260660/FullSizeRender_24_or4mju.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbi2zounq/image/upload/c_scale,h_1400/v1692260655/FullSizeRender_23_zsjphm.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"some-preliminary-mostly-food-related-highlights-from-two-weeks-in-norway-sweden-and-denmark\">Some preliminary (mostly food-related) highlights from two weeks in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>So far, not impressed with Norwegian bakeries</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunost\">Brunost</a>, however, is my new favorite snack.</li>\n  <li>The quiet atmosphere of the fjords in the Summer months is spectacular.

It’s the city’s first <a href=\"https://pride.amsterdam/en/pride-foundation/\">two-week Pride festival in Amsterdam</a>, each week organized by a different organization. With a naturally intersectional and radically-inclusive interpretation of the term “queer”, I am pleased <a href=\"https://queer-amsterdam.org/\">Queer Amsterdam</a> is taking care of the annual Pride Walk.</p>\n\n<p>On Friday, I tell colleagues over office drinks why we still need Pride. The fact that I had to write “an anonymous friend” instead of the name of a person I love and admire illustrates my point beautifully.</p>\n\n<p>“I think I’ll wear my face mask” he says, 20 minutes into the event. “Am I getting too close?” I ask, concerned. No, he just doesn’t feel comfortable being photographed. The off chance that his parents may see him is not worth it.</p>\n\n<p>As we walk, I think about the meaning of the word “pride”. If we walk in a Pride March, can we be proud without wanting to be photographed and broadcast for anyone to see? A sign in the crowd reads “you can’t be what you can’t see”, and I agree. Representation is crucial, to this my life is a testament. But what burden does that place on people whose visibility is dangerous to themselves?</p>\n\n<p>The intersection of queerdom, the way it interacts with ethnicity, religion, ability, neurodivergence, age, education, and location, is why I’m here today. Why I’m here at all. Mehdi, who has never attended a Pride event in his life, learns to shout along:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What do we want?<br />\nTRANS RIGHTS!<br />\nWhen do we want them?<br />\nNOW!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The speeches this year spark my interest. <a href=\"https://pride.amsterdam/ambassadors/tieneke-sumter/\">Tieneke</a> talks about consent, an oft-overlooked point of concern in our queer communities. Someone whose name I forgot talks about bisexuality. I remember how unsettling it was as a young adult that people told me I was “in transit”, on my way to being either gay or straight.</p>\n\n<p>I’m here today shouting for myself, a little bit, but also to engage in the praxis of allyship which is by default an aspirational habit: doing the things we know to be right, without determining for other people whether we can call ourselves their allies.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbi2zounq/image/upload/v1690043403/FullSizeRender_qbh0ze.jpg\" alt=\"A person in a trenchcoat and a hat looks on as a Pride march walks by, photographing the event\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbi2zounq/image/upload/v1690043396/FullSizeRender_2_alxoze.jpg\" alt=\"A person in a colorful jacket walks in a Pride march\" /></p>\n\n<!-- ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbi2zounq/image/upload/v1690043404/IMG_3947_nmdiap.jpg) -->",
