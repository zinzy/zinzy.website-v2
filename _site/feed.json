Despite a <a href=\"/2023/11/19/week-46\">negative test</a>, symptoms tell me everything I need to know. I have to remind myself every day this week that, given the regulations, I‚Äôm not obliged to quarantine. Nevertheless, Anja and I are both barely able to walk the dog. I work half days, and spend my afternoons in bed with hot water bottles.</p>\n\n<p>Later in the week, I have cabin fever that is so intense it makes me cry in the park a little bit. On Sunday, the only thing I‚Äôm left with is a stuffy nose as well as some fatigue. God, I hope I don‚Äôt develop long Covid.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"consuming\">Consuming</h3>\n<p>Anja and I watch season two of <em>Somebody Somewhere</em>.

Most people in my safe, progressive, friendly Amsterdam that I‚Äôve spoken with are gobsmacked. Party leader Geert Wilders has become Geert Milders.

            "content_html": "<ul>\n  <li>I‚Äôm making an attempt this week to make my weeknotes more of a personal record rather than a performance of how exciting my week is. What I‚Äôve written answers the question I might ask myself seven years from now: what was life like this week?</li>\n  <li>I went on the road for on-site research on Tuesday, and was delighted by the particular nursing home that we visited. It seems many Dutch healthcare organizations have understood that environments that resemble the real-life environments of patients contribute to their overall wellbeing. The various spaces we saw were tailored to what life must have been like when the elderly clients were younger: a fifties barber shop, a diner-like restaurant. It was endearing. More professionally, I continue to be stunned by the working lives of people in healthcare. Having to balance tight budgets and strict schedules on the one hand and genuinely wanting the best for clients on the other is not an easy feat.</li>\n  <li>It seems like I did pick up Covid while there.</li>\n  <li>I‚Äôve begun watching <em>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters</em> and I love my life. The farther I become removed from the humanities major version of myself, the easier it becomes to admit I love monster disaster stories.</li>\n  <li>I‚Äôve also begun watching the second season of <em>The Morning Show</em>, and two episodes in I understand why Anja urged me to really, <em>really</em> give it a try. Reese Witherspoon making out with Julianna Margulies is not the stuff of dreams I thought I needed, but here we are. Acting, storyline etc. also good.</li>\n  <li>The Israel-Hamas War continues to rage, which has begun to feel like a weird name for the conflict. I wonder what it means that, when I Google those words, the Wikipedia entry to which I‚Äôm directed is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hamas_attack_on_Israel\">\n2023 Hamas attack on Israel</a>.</li>\n  <li>I will never have first-hand experience of what it means to be a Jewish person in the world today, although I‚Äôve been having a second-hand experience that has been leaving me‚Ä¶ perturbed. When people discover my partner is Jewish, the tone of the conversation shifts. Not in a pro-Palestinian way, but in the way Jenna Maroney felt the urge to touch Liz Lemon‚Äôs hand after learning that Liz had met Oprah on a flight (which, of course, turned out to be a random Black woman).</li>\n  <li>While I tested negative, I did spend Friday evening and night in bed with a fever and a body that felt as though it had been hit by a truck. Anja did test positive on Sunday, and so now we‚Äôre quarantining. March 2020 all over again.</li>\n  <li>I keep thinking a lot about Osama Bin Laden. About the lack of context given by the journalist who shared parts of his <em>Letter to the American people</em> on social media. How TikTok and X, at least for a moment, were rife with people who were barely born when 9/11 happened, proclaiming support for Bin Laden because he had pro-Palestinian things to say. About the importance of digital literacy in the classroom.</li>\n  <li>Whenever I‚Äôm ill, I bake or cook. I feel bad not doing anything and lying in bed all day, and following a recipe always seems like a good way to pass the time. This week, I made apple crumble custard <em>vlaai</em>. You can take the girl out of Limburg (and thank God for that), but‚Ä¶</li>\n</ul>",

            "title": "The artificial borders of climate activism",
            "content_html": "<p>Yesterday at the Climate March, someone shouted <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_river_to_the_sea#Criticism\">‚ÄúFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free‚Äù</a>. It was an unfortunate thing. A clean example of the climate changing instantaneously among 85,000 activists.</p>\n\n<p>I was there for four reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>My definition of God is ‚Äúscience is indescribably beautiful and we must respect her‚Äù</li>\n  <li>I can‚Äôt think of a more regrettable waste of tax money than having to spend it on health issues we can prevent if only we take better care of our environment</li>\n  <li>I have a weak spot for an activist friend, who, through stealth influencing, had instilled in me a deep sense of FOMO about the event</li>\n  <li>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_in_the_Netherlands\">Dutch carnival season</a> had kicked off on November 11, and I was in the mood for a parade</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The phrase was understandable coming from the Palestinian woman. Still, I appreciate that its most vicious context of use taints it so ferociously with antisemitism that deploying it as a vehicle for unity is a recipe for disaster. The crowd was so immense that it took hours of dancing in place before we even got started on the route. By the time we got to Museum Square, the words had already left the woman‚Äôs mouth.</p>\n\n<p>We got there just in time to watch Greta Thunberg, who had been marching with us, turning her face away from cameras to remind us of why she was there. In between her on the stage and us on the field there were three screens, each projecting her face from a distance. I <em>believe</em> she was there, but the crowd was too big to say anything with much certainty.</p>\n\n<p>My activist friend is one of those rare white people: privileged enough to belong to the 1% of a <em>variety</em> of subgroups, yet so antiracist it brings a tear to your eye. A seeker of nuance and complexity. A political unicorn. As we stood in the longest line I had ever seen, sharing the weight of a ‚ÄúTHE CRISIS IS NOW‚Äù banner, I said to her: ‚Äúit‚Äôs so‚Ä¶ White here.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said, mildly embarrassed it seemed, ‚Äúit‚Äôs actually a huge problem for us that we could use some help with.‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>Growing up in the Dutch South, there was a peculiar detail to the way I engaged with other people of color. I didn‚Äôt. There was no nod in the street, no tribe to which I belonged, no ‚Äúour stories of minority and loneliness resonate‚Äù. Color blindness was the tune, and we were dancing to it. After almost a decade in Amsterdam I‚Äôve come to consider this lack of acknowledgement poor behavior. There‚Äôs not a black person in the neighborhood I don‚Äôt know. I had forgotten my life wasn‚Äôt always like this, until yesterday. I counted no more than ten people of color in the crowd, and I exchanged looks with not a single one of them.</p>\n\n<p>Whenever I find myself in a sea of vast whiteness, I ask myself: ‚Äúwhere am I, why are there no other people of color here, and should I <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5052448/\"><em>Get Out</em></a>?‚Äù Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love white people. <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeOfMyBestFriendsAreX\">Some of my best friends are white people.</a> My <em>wife</em> is a white person. Consider it a habit I‚Äôve developed growing up in the Netherlands, where nothing about ethnicity is quite as it seems.</p>\n\n<p>What solidifies Greta Thunberg‚Äôs identity as a Zoomer is the radical solidarity she and her contemporaries practice, seemingly without effort. Once she finally got on stage, her first act of compassion was to return the word to the Palestinian woman whose sound had been disconnected immediately after she had said the phrase.</p>\n\n<p>What followed is what you may expect to happen when a person traumatized by an active war has to find it in herself to pick up where she left off to tell 85,000 mostly white faces how climate justice and justice for Palestine can exist on the same stage.</p>\n\n<p>It was <em>mayhem</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Once Greta had the mic again, she decided to keep her speech brief, much to the dismay I‚Äôm sure of all the people who felt blessed to share a moment in Amsterdam with her. Not <em>so</em> brief, however, that a man couldn‚Äôt walk on stage and declare he was there for the climate and not for politics.</p>\n\n<p>The respectability politics are vile today. All I can think about is the power of the speech that could have been. The one in which a Palestinian woman addresses a vast sea of white faces who all listen intently to her talk about climate change. The way she says the words ‚Äúriver‚Äù and ‚Äúsea‚Äù only when referring to natural bodies of water. The way she captivates her audience until the very end, when she pulls a Hannah Gadsby to remind us all of the hypocrisy and dangers of compartmental solidarity. The way she nods quietly to the upcoming elections.</p>\n\n<p>The respectability politics are vile today. March-induced feelings of disappointment, uninspired virtue signalling, and racism find each other. A discombobulated display of on-stage pain and the very notion of pro-Palestinian sentiment have quickly been conflated into a rhetoric with which I feel increasingly uncomfortable: that people in power decide when minorities speak about their place in the world. That, when we talk about climate justice, every other topic must give way. That, when we march for a cause that seems to predominantly attract white people, unwritten rules of radical inclusion don‚Äôt apply. I feel the climate activism community interviewed for a job with me, and as a result I want to burn its r√©sum√©.</p>\n\n<p>It makes me sad.</p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôm sad because there are people who think climate justice can exist outside of politics. I‚Äôm sad because so many people don‚Äôt understand that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_personal_is_political\">the personal is political</a>. I‚Äôm sad because I want to engage in climate activism, but I don‚Äôt feel there‚Äôs a place for me at the table. I‚Äôm sad because, right now, climate activism feels like a Gutmensch hobby. I‚Äôm sad for all the people who can‚Äôt tell the difference between antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment. I‚Äôm sad for our Uncle Eli from Tel Aviv who is in and out of his bomb shelter all day.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p><em>I delivered this sermon today at <a href=\"http://allsaintsamsterdam.church/\">All Saints Amsterdam</a>.</em></p>\n\n<p>A few months ago, along with much of humanity, it seemed, I went to see <em>Barbie</em>. Walking out of the theatre and forming an opinion on this intro to feminism, I renamed the film to a title which I will use again today: ‚ÄúBlueprints: a pamphlet against simplicity‚Äù.</p>\n\n<p>It‚Äôs nice to see all of your faces here today. I‚Äôve met most of you before, but let me make an official introduction. My name is Zinzy, I‚Äôm 35 years old, I live in Amsterdam, and I work in the tech industry. I‚Äôm an interaction designer at a medical technology company, which is to say that I design the ways in which doctors and nurses interact with my company‚Äôs software. My job is to find out how we can improve the lives of essential workers. It involves a lot of research, empathizing, and imagining. The phrase I repeat over and over again is: ‚ÄúHow might we‚Ä¶?‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>When people ask me how I came to have such a cool job, I always tell them about my degree in Comparative Literature, and the time I spent studying Theology. It never fails to throw them off. After all, what could be further apart than the literary canon and the abracadabra I do at work all day?</p>\n\n<p>When it comes down to it, really, I just love a good story. I love looking at the ways in which we attempt to make sense of the world around us as well as the world within us. I like stories because of what they say about us. I like stories because we use them in our attempts to humanize others. The truest and sweetest opinion I have on humans is that we are storytelling animals.</p>\n\n<p>When we tell a story, we take a reality (fictional or non-fictional), weave together its most important events and actors, and have our audience look at them through the eyes of one or more entities. To tell a story is an act of selection, of extraction from the truth what we deem important. To tell a story is to curate reality. To tell a story is to shape the world. We turn something complex into vehicles for education, entertainment, action. We abstract from <em>what is</em>, so our shared language is easy to comprehend.</p>\n\n<p>Let me give you an example. Here are two stories about Jesus. One. God has a Son who is also God, he is perfect, and we will never be as good as him, but let‚Äôs try. Two. There was a baby born in humility, who grew up to be an inspiration to billions. He was murdered because people thought he was evil, but we never forgot his name. Two stories that invoke entirely different responses. Two stories that remind us that the storyteller is the one who holds the power.</p>\n\n<p>Today, the story we‚Äôre telling each other is that of Christian saints. When Mpho suggested I preach about this, my thought process brought me from Mother Teresa via ‚Äúoh-oh, I am certainly going to screw this up‚Äù to the most important commandment in the tech industry: ask why before you ask how.</p>\n\n<p>Before we dive in, let me tell you what I <em>can‚Äôt</em> do today. I can‚Äôt do is tell you how I think reliving the stories of saints will get us into the Kingdom of Heaven. I can‚Äôt even tell you about my favorite saint, because I don‚Äôt have one. What I <em>can</em> do is share with you what I have: questions. Questions about questions. Questions about stories. Lots and lots of questions. Today, I hold onto what I know, how to build successful technology, to wade into what I don‚Äôt.</p>\n\n<p>Saints. ‚ÄúThese are the ones coming out of great tribulation‚Äù the lessons tell us. Throughout the centuries, first informally and locally, and then because Popes began restricting to themselves the right to canonize, we‚Äôve collected hundreds upon hundreds of saints. Apostles, martyrs, confessors. Human beings who were perceived to have an exceptional degree of holiness, likeness, or closeness to God.</p>\n\n<p>And today, still, many of us find inspiration in the stories about these people. They‚Äôre exemplary models, extraordinary teachers, wonder workers. They‚Äôre intercessors through whom we pray. Their stories are designed to inspire us into devotion, into serving God day and night in God‚Äôs temple, which is the world. When I think of it, saints <em>are</em> stories. After all, we never get the full picture, just what we‚Äôve chosen is relevant enough to repeat.</p>\n\n<p>These stories fall perfectly in step with the rhythm of Christianity, the rhythm of the Western world. The rhythm of looking for what we could have and could be. What we don‚Äôt have, and what we are not. Yet. We live in a culture of becoming. A culture, and a religion, of harder, better, faster, stronger. A culture of progression. Saints were designed to propel us towards the next best thing.</p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôm no different from the culture in which I grew up: I love progress. I love growth, I love my learner‚Äôs mentality. I love that we use the saintly canon, a set of stories we‚Äôve chosen to prioritize, to be better tomorrow than we are today. But there‚Äôs a flip side.</p>\n\n<p>I struggle.</p>\n\n<p>I struggle with saints, with how our tradition has curated, abstracted their human realities. I struggle with the fact that this is an effect of storytelling <em>at all</em>. I struggle with what happens when details go missing, when nuance is lost. I struggle with how, without details and nuance, we idealize as quickly as we devalue. The absence of details turn excellent <em>Harry Potter</em> books into pretty ok <em>Harry Potter</em> movies. It turns Mary Teresa, a sweet, charitable nun with questionable opinions on the realities of sexual violence in the Catholic church, into the pinnacle of female selflessness. It turns inhabitants of Gaza into terrorists. It turns Judaism into the root of all evil.</p>\n\n<p>The art of storytelling is a sharp, double-edged sword. And I want to learn how to handle it more carefully, both as a speaker and as a listener.</p>\n\n<p>I struggle with how stories about saints make us compare our insides to other people‚Äôs outsides. Even the word ‚Äúsaint‚Äù itself doesn‚Äôt necessarily invoke an atmosphere of reaching for the attainable. I struggle with this the same way I struggle with Beyonc√©, who, at 23, won her first Grammy, an age at which I took five weeks to find the best typeface for my bachelor thesis.</p>\n\n<p>I struggle with how I can‚Äôt see myself in the saints. And I need to see myself in someone to learn from them. As a queer person of color, I am intimately familiar with what it means when I can‚Äôt see myself in people. It invokes a sense of otherness, not a sense of community and hope. Color me a Christian millennial, but I learn from <em>mistakes</em>, not from other people‚Äôs highlight reels.</p>\n\n<p>I know that, when it comes to the differences between veneration, adoration, admiration, idolatry, and worship, the Catechism of the Catholic Church will tell you I‚Äôm doing it wrong. I think that‚Äôs just her modus operandi. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm doing it wrong. I think there‚Äôs a flaw in the interaction design of how we‚Äôve been taught to grow.</p>\n\n<p>The lesson is this: you are not enough, other people are, and you should feel inspired to be more like them. Inspired by Jesus, Mother Teresa, St. Augustine, Beyonce, Stephen Hawking, Barbie, the Barbie, the resistance fighters. I don‚Äôt need a superhuman who can show me how to become more like them. I need a lifetime of flaws to remind me how to be a better me because someone else became a better them.</p>\n\n<p>As a designer, I will forever defend the right of a design flaw to exist. In fact, if we ignore the design flaw, we‚Äôll never be able to make things better. We must look at the problem before we come up with a solution. We must ask why before we ask how.</p>\n\n<p>Why <em>might</em> we become better? And then:</p>\n\n<p><em>How</em> might we use stories in a way that retains our individuality, our dignity, and leaves a margin for error, and room for doubt? How might we let the saints, all the names in the Bible, the very humans they were, inspire us to see ourselves in each other without concluding that we fail to imitate the blueprint?</p>\n\n<p>How might we become better co-humans so that the Kingdom of Heaven is what we refer to when we say ‚Äúwow, that was a really happy moment for me‚Äù? How might we do unto others as we would have them do unto us? How might we remember that <em>that</em> is the entire law, and the rest is just commentary?</p>\n\n<p>Amen.</p>",

I continue to struggle to notice when I feel stresed or overwhelmed, and it never fails to result in my body giving me a clear sign. On Monday evening, in the midst of a busy work month, my body said ‚ÄúSIT. DOWN.‚Äù I needed undtil well into the weekend to feel myself again.</li>\n  <li>One of the signs my body knows to give it a very mild version of conversion disorder: I lose the ability to listen to a conversation while I walk without feeling very dizzy. Isn‚Äôt the body a beautiful, very annoying, but magnificent thing?</li>\n  <li>I start back up at work on Thursday, working the mornings until the weekend. It‚Äôs good to acknowledge things aren‚Äôt great., It brings clarity and rest.</li>\n  <li>On Friday evening <a href=\"/2023/09/30/film-club-s01e01\">I attend the first edition</a> of a new local film club I joined. It confirms what I already know: I love the horror genre, and I love discussing cinema with people who didn‚Äôt finish film school Anja I‚Äôm looking at you.</li>\n  <li>Ever since we <a href=\"/2023/08/17/norway-et-al\">visited Hija de Sanchez in Copenhagen</a> Anja and I have gotten really into Mexican food. By now, I‚Äôm so well-versed in the art of a simple-but-sublime taco, that I whip up a delicious meal. Who knew tacos required so little filling?</li>\n  <li>On Saturday, I visit Micropia, a zoo-adjacent museum about microbes. I expect to be queasy throughout the entire visit, terrified by the unfortunate-looking mini animals that live in and on every part of my body. Instead, I‚Äôm amazed by the beauty of nature. During the mini class I ask a question about algae: if their bodies move towards light and they‚Äôre under a microscope for a while, where light comes from all sides, what happens to their health? The laboratory assistant tells me the museum swaps petri dishes regularly so that the algea don‚Äôt die. What happens before death, though, I wonder.</li>\n  <li>On Sunday, Chenelva comes over for afternoon drinks. She‚Äôs one of those rare people: an instant connection and plenty of common ground to grow out friendship on. We marvel at how little we know about queer BIPOC Amsterdam.</li>\n  <li>We‚Äôve completed the first season of the Dutch reality show ‚ÄúB&amp;B vol liefde‚Äù, in which B&amp;B owners invite four dates into their home. Hate-watching reality television with Anja is one of my favorite pastimes.</li>\n</ul>",

By the time I‚Äôm writing this the sky is gray and it‚Äôs raining, but this week‚Äôs weather was cheerful and moderate.</li>\n  <li>On Tuesday and Wednesday I gave two big UX workshops at week to help coworkers understand how they can use UX in their daily work. I‚Äôve been giving workshops for well over a decade, always trusting my instinct to figure out what a particular group or context required. At work, though, we have two wonderful scrum masters who are well-versed in the art of facilitation. I learned a <em>lot</em> from their feedback, and saw a hugh jump between the quality of the first day and of the second day.</li>\n  <li>I caught up with a special friend on Wednesday, a young woman I met because we were treated for the same health condition. Her life as a Psych major couldn‚Äôt be more different from mine, and yet the red threads our lives resemble one another. I‚Äôm fortunate to call her my friend.</li>\n  <li>I had missed a few weeks in my RSS reader, but I was pleased to see Manuel Moreale‚Äôs <em><a href=\"https://manuelmoreale.com/\">People &amp; Blogs</a></em> is off to a good start. To hell with Anja calling me a geek for being into the IndieWeb, I love visiting other people‚Äôs websites. I suspect I love reading what they have to say about those websites even more.</li>\n  <li>Last week, I had met an amazing couple of lesbians who invited me over for a casual dinner party on Friday. After a particularly challenging week, it was comforting to hear their experiences as people of color in the world today. I‚Äôm already looking forward to inviting them to our place.</li>\n  <li>On Saturday, Anja and I kicked off the weekend with a spontaneous redesign of our living room. We finally got rid of my desk, which was a Covid-era purchase used for our home office. What remains now is Anja‚Äôs bigger desk, which functions as a dining room table that she hates more than I do. The removal of our home office allowed us to place our sofa there, which has giving the living room a significant amount of extra space. The dining room table continues to double as an office whenever we put our ultrawide monitor there. I like <span title=\"This points to a note, but it is private\" class=\"invalid-link\">  <span class=\"invalid-link-brackets\"></span>  modular living  <span class=\"invalid-link-brackets\"></span></span>, and I‚Äôm feeling less and less awkward about the way we‚Äôre going about it in our house.</li>\n  <li>At the end of our cleaning sprint Anja mentioned it was a beautiful day for this accomplishment, since it was Rosh Hashanah. New living room, new beginnings.</li>\n  <li>After visiting Anja‚Äôs mom in the afternoon, we biked to Kriterion to Watch <span title=\"This points to a note, but it is private\" class=\"invalid-link\">  <span class=\"invalid-link-brackets\"></span>  Oppenheimer (2023)  <span class=\"invalid-link-brackets\"></span></span>.</li>\n  <li>Much like the last few days, I‚Äôm not in the best of states. There‚Äôs an old sadness that keeps saying hello, and I‚Äôm slowly beginning to think it might be time to get some help with it.</li>\n  <li>I‚Äôm nearing the end of my journal, and I‚Äôm surprised by how unnervous I am by the few pages I have left. In this past, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/7/12/20680004/notebook-journal-finish-strategies\">like the rest of the world, as it appears</a>, I had trouble finishing a journal in a relaxed manner. Looking at the first entry, I see I have 29 days left until it‚Äôll have been one year exactly. Hello nerves.</li>\n</ul>",

Getting out of a hot shower and feeling equally wet fifteen minutes later. Lemonade barely wanting to walk outside. The sun beaming so feriously we can‚Äôt keep the windows open. Thank you, Jesus, but please make it cooler.</li>\n  <li>There‚Äôs something sweet about seeing Amsterdam through the eyes of friends from abroad. On Tuesday, I couldn‚Äôt have been more excited to welcome my <a href=\"https://vineandfig.co/\">Vine &amp; Fig friends</a> Pickles and Patrick to the city. They‚Äôre two Irish Catholic gay men named Patrick, so we try to make it work any way we can.</li>\n  <li>I was saddened by the fact that Jacob, Patrick‚Äôs husband, couldn‚Äôt make it because he had to stay home and help their dog Jude recover from surgery. All week, I felt like we were missing a limb.</li>\n  <li>I joined the V&amp;F leadership team in mid 2020, and we‚Äôve been growing a friendship since. The moment I saw them I knew we were going to get along perfectly in real life, too. Finally getting to embrace them felt like to most natural thing in the world.</li>\n  <li>Their AirBnb, which is located just off of Vijzelgracht, was absolutely ridiculous. A three-bedroom penthouse overlooking De Pijp, enormous backyard below, include Swedish saunas and swimming pools. This is how the other half lives.</li>\n  <li>I made time to hang out with the Patricks every day they were here, which took us to sweet places. I took them to <a href=\"https://takeichi-ramen.eu/\">Takeichi</a>, my favorite ramen place where I always order anything but ramen, and to <a href=\"https://studio-k.nu/\">Studio K</a>, where they met Lemonade, who chewed through her leash in what seemed like a quiet moment.</li>\n  <li>On Friday, we went cheese and wine tasting at <a href=\"https://abrahamkef.nl/vestigingen/proeflokaal/\">Abraham Kef in Noord</a>. It reminded me of how much I love cheese. It was the first thing I was able to say after I learned to say ‚Äúmomma‚Äù. I want to make my own cheese.</li>\n  <li>After dinner at <a href=\"https://thuskomme.nl/\">Thuskomme</a> on Saturday we took silly mugshots with my Polaroid camera.</li>\n  <li>It is truly wonderful to spend time with the Patricks, with whom I weave in and out of conversation topics like it‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs business. One minute we‚Äôre talking about sex toys, and the next about the Book of Job. Knowing they were going to be leaving made me cry a little bit, but then I remembered our friendship had survived without physical get-togethers for three years already.</li>\n  <li>On Friday, I met with Mpho to chat church business. I‚Äôve been discerning all Summer about how I would want to be involved in the church now that it‚Äôs becoming a church plant, and I decided maintaining the website and social media was a commitment I could make.</li>\n  <li>On Sunday, All Saints held her homecoming gathering after the Summer break. Kyle Rader, our new minister, was there for the first time. I liked the elder millennial vibe he brings to the service. It was intimate and lovely, although I seriously missed the pianist. After the service, we gathered for a potluck dinner in the bishop‚Äôs garden next to the church. I showed the logo ideas I had been working on, to friendly compliments.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbi2zounq/image/upload/v1694936600/IMG_5896_clkzw4.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbi2zounq/image/upload/v1694936602/FullSizeRender_2_mznjqq.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dbi2zounq/image/upload/v1694936600/FullSizeRender_fgwrwq.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>",

I think the world was trying to introduce me to something for which I wasn‚Äôt ready yet. Looking back, that date, more than the others, prepared me for Anja. Looking back through butterfly effect glasses, it might as well have been him.</p>\n\n<p>Yesterday wasn‚Äôt a great day. They say recovery is a habit and it is. I was feeling quite low about myself. One hour at my friend‚Äôs citizenship party and I‚Äôd call it a night. Tomorrow would be full of things, too. Then he arrived. Like an old friend entering the scene.</p>\n\n<p>As soon as I head over, we hug, and he begins telling me that he talks about me when he‚Äôs teaching storytelling, on an almost weekly basis, eight years on. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs when I begin to talk about tension-building‚Äù he says, and I laugh loudly, after which he eyebrows ‚Äúyou know what moment I‚Äôm talking about, right?‚Äù I say yes but I don‚Äôt. Back then, I was too drunk to really remember anything with accuracy.</p>\n\n<p>He turns towards to his friends and continues. ‚ÄúI lean in to kiss her, but she rejects me. And I‚Äôm so nervous, thinking ‚Äògosh, did I really misread all the signs?!‚Äô‚Äù Apparently, then I said these words, which‚Ä¶:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Wait. This is the last moment that you and I have never kissed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As he was telling this story, my entire body lit up. Partially turned on, but predominantly struck with delight. Who is that person? Can I have her number? Oh hold on, he‚Äôs talking about me.</p>\n\n<p>Two things can be true at once, and for a moment, my experience of myself felt finely in balance. The universe can hold me as the asshole I see in myself, but also as the person whose butterfly wings can make a small change.</p>\n\n<p>I spent the rest of the evening meeting kind strangers. White cis gay men who wanted to join the queer meetup I run, where my friend and I met. Kinfolk, effortlessly introduced as we blew <span title=\"This points to a note, but it is private\" class=\"invalid-link\">  <span class=\"invalid-link-brackets\"></span>  Cat whisper  <span class=\"invalid-link-brackets\"></span></span>s at each other.</p>\n\n<p>My friend looked stunning. An impeccable sense of style, a smile larger than the world, a citizenship bigger than we‚Äôd ever ask of him. I knew he was suspended mid-air in all sorts of areas of his life, but, looking at him, I suspected he had arrived somewhere long before any of us ever would.</p>\n\n<p>Today, grabbing coffee in the neighborhood, I meet an acquaintance who‚Äôs on sabbatical until the end of the year, spending his time taking action lessons, storytelling workshops.  I ask him if he has ever heard of the girl who almost rejected a kiss by the sea and he bursts out laughing.</p>",
