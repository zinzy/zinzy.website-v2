<p>A wicked problem is a challenge with so many interdependent factors that it seems impossible to solve.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> It originated in social planning.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>I’ve found that <a class="internal-link" href="/enterprise-ux">Enterprise UX</a> is a particularly good platform for such problems to fester. Generative research might surface a problem, and soon it appears that there are other problems that are very closely related to it. Before you know it, one feature request has turned into a six-month research project.</p>

<p>The danger of wicked problems is that they might create analysis paralysis. I’ve seen many product people (myself included) losing the forest for the trees. It’s important to keep the conversation in a team open enough that we can <span title="This note is not for public consumption (yet)" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Make a decision  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span>.</p>

<p>An explanation of this term I also like is “a problem whose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_complexity" title="Social complexity" target="_blank">social complexity</a> means that it has no determinable stopping point”.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
