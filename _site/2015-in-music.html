<p>In many ways, 2015 was a transformative year for me. I dropped out of seminary because, frankly, I felt too gay. I was working on a novel, I was tutoring, and I was slowly, very slowly, growing out of a 6-year relationship. Much of my soundtrack of 2015 is made up of party songs that played at the bars I used to frequent while I was living in Haarlem.</p>
