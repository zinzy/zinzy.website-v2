# StatiCrypt

StatiCrypt uses AES-256 to encrypt your HTML file with your long password and return a static page including a password prompt and the javascript decryption logic that you can safely upload anywhere (see [what the page looks like](https://robinmoisson.github.io/staticrypt/example/example_encrypted.html)).

This means you can **password protect the content of your _public_ static HTML file, without any back-end** - serving it over Netlify, GitHub pages, etc. (see the detail of [how it works](#how-staticrypt-works)).

You can encrypt a file online in your browser (client side) at https://robinmoisson.github.io/staticrypt, or use the CLI to do it in your build process.

## CLI

### Installation

Staticrypt is available through npm as a CLI, install with

```bash
npm install staticrypt
```

You can then run it with `npx staticrypt ...`. You can also install globally with `npm install -g staticrypt` and then just call `staticrypt ...`.

### Examples

> These will create a `.staticrypt.json` file in the current directory, see the FAQ as to why. You can prevent it by setting the `--config` flag to "false".

**Encrypt a file:** Encrypt `test.html` and create a `test_encrypted.html` file (add `-o my_encrypted_file.html` to change the name of the output file):

```bash
staticrypt test.html MY_LONG_PASSWORD
```

**Encrypt a file with the password in an environment variable:** set your long password in the `STATICRYPT_PASSWORD` environment variable ([`.env` files](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv#usage) are supported):

```bash
# the password is in the STATICRYPT_PASSWORD env variable
staticrypt test.html
```

**Encrypt a file and get a shareable link containing the hashed password** - you can include your file URL or leave blank:

```bash
# you can also pass '--share' without specifying the URL to get the `?staticrypt_pwd=...` 
staticrypt test.html MY_LONG_PASSWORD --share https://example.com/test_encrypted.html
# => https://example.com/test_encrypted.html?staticrypt_pwd=5bfbf1343c7257cd7be23ecd74bb37fa2c76d041042654f358b6255baeab898f
```

**Encrypt all html files in a directory** and replace them with encrypted versions (`{}` will be replaced with each file name by the `find` command - if you wanted to move the encrypted files to an `encrypted/` directory, you could use `-o encrypted/{}`):

```bash
find . -type f -name "*.html" -exec staticrypt {} MY_LONG_PASSWORD -o {} \;
```

**Encrypt all html files in a directory except** the ones ending in `_encrypted.html`:

```bash
find . -type f -name "*.html" -not -name "*_encrypted.html" -exec staticrypt {} MY_LONG_PASSWORD \;
```

## HOW STATICRYPT WORKS

So, how can you password protect html without a back-end?

StatiCrypt uses the [crypto-js](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js) library to generate a static, password protected page that can be decrypted in-browser. You can then just send or upload the generated page to a place serving static content (github pages, for example) and you're done: the page will prompt users for a password, and the javascript will decrypt and load your HTML, all done in the browser.

So it basically encrypts your page and puts everything in a user-friendly way to use a password in the new file.

## FAQ

### Is it secure?

Simple answer: your file content has been encrypted with AES-256 (CBC), a popular and strong encryption algorithm, you can now upload it in any public place and no one will be able to read it without the password. So if you used a long, strong password, then yes it should be pretty secure.

That being said, actual security always depends on a number of factors and on the threat model you want to protect against. Because your full encrypted file is accessible client side, brute-force/dictionary attacks would be easy to do at a really fast pace: **use a long, unusual password**. We recommend 16+ alphanum characters, [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) is a great open-source password manager if you don't have one already. 

On the technical aspects: we use AES in CBC mode (see a discussion on why it's appropriate for StatiCrypt in [#19](https://github.com/robinmoisson/staticrypt/issues/19)) and 15k PBKDF2 iterations (it will be 600k when we'll switch to WebCrypto, read a detailed report on why these numbers in [#159](https://github.com/robinmoisson/staticrypt/issues/159)).

**Also, disclaimer:** I am not a cryptographer - the concept is simple and I try my best to implement it correctly but please adjust accordingly: if you are an at-risk activist or have sensitive crypto data to protect, you might want to use something else.

### Can I customize the password prompt?

Yes! Just copy `lib/password_template.html`, modify it to suit your style and point to your template file with the `-f path/to/my/file.html` flag. Be careful to not break the encrypting javascript part, the variables replaced by StatiCrypt are between curly brackets: `{salt}`.

### Can I remove the "Remember me" checkbox?

If you don't want the checkbox to be included, you can add the `--noremember` flag to disable it.

### Why do we embed the whole crypto-js library in each encrypted file by default?

Some adblockers used to see the `crypto-js.min.js` served by CDN, think that's a crypto miner and block it. If you don't want to include it and serve from a CDN instead, you can add `--embed false`.

### Why does StatiCrypt create a config file?

The "Remember me" feature stores the user password hashed and salted in the browser's localStorage, so it needs the salt to be the same each time you encrypt otherwise the user would be logged out when you encrypt the page again. The config file is a way to store the salt in between runs, so you don't have to remember it and pass it manually.

When deciding what salt to use, StatiCrypt will first look for a `--salt` flag, then try to get the salt from the config file, and if it still doesn't find a salt it will generate a random one. It then saves the salt in the config file.

If you don't want StatiCrypt to create or use the config file, you can set `--config false` to disable it.

The salt isn't secret, so you don't need to worry about hiding the config file.

### How does the "Remember me" checkbox work?

The CLI will add a "Remember me" checkbox on the password prompt by default (`--noremember` to disable). If the user checks it, the (salted + hashed) password will be stored in their browser's localStorage and the page will attempt to auto-decrypt when they come back.

If no value is provided the stored password doesn't expire, you can also give it a value in days for how long should the store value be kept with `-r NUMBER_OF_DAYS`. If the user reconnects to the page after the expiration date the stored value will be cleared.

#### "Logging out"

You can clear StatiCrypt values in localStorage (effectively "logging out") at any time by appending `staticrypt_logout` to the URL query parameters (`mysite.com?staticrypt_logout`).

#### Encrypting multiple pages

This allows encrypting multiple page on a single domain with the same password: if you check "Remember me", you'll have to enter your password once then all the pages on that domain will automatically decrypt their content. Because the hashed value is stored in the browser's localStorage, this will only work if all the pages are on the same domain name.

#### Is the "Remember me" checkbox secure?

In case the value stored in the browser becomes compromised an attacker can decrypt the page, but because it's stored salted and hashed this should still protect against password reuse attacks if you've used the password on other websites (of course, please use a long, unique password nonetheless).

## Community and alternatives

Here are some other projects and community resources you might find interesting (this is included as an informative section, I haven't personally vetted any of those).

### Alternatives to StatiCrypt

[MaxLaumeister/PageCrypt](https://github.com/MaxLaumeister/PageCrypt) is a project with similar features in a different style (I think it was created before StatiCrypt).

### Based on StatiCrypt

**WebCrypto:** https://github.com/tarpdalton/staticrypt/tree/webcrypto is a fork that uses the WebCrypto browser api to encrypt and decrypt the page, which removes the need for `crypto-js`. There's a PR open towards here which I haven't checked in detail yet. WebCrypto is only available in HTTPS context (which [is annoying people](https://github.com/w3c/webcrypto/issues/28)) so it won't work if you're on HTTP.

**Template to host an encrypted single page website with Github Pages:** [a-nau/password-protected-website-template](https://github.com/a-nau/password-protected-website-template) is a demonstration of how to build a protected page on Github Pages, integrating with Github Actions
