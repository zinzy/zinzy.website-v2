What is the deal with people and coffee? No, let's try that again. What is the deal with people and dish water? Coffee[^1] these days. Is. Disgusting.

A Starbucks recently opened in Utrecht, and to celebrate the occassion, a dear friend of mine, whom I hadn't seen in two years, suggested we meet there for a pumpkin spiced whatever. 

Pat, I'd love to buy a middle finger. Or else perhaps just a question mark.
