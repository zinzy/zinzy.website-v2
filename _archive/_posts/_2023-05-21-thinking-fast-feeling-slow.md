I have a habit of losing sight of what is there. I have a tattoo on my lower left arm to remind me. Sometimes I convince myself I've thought my way out of a feelings problem, only to have those feelings catch up with me days later. The eternal web of detours I began unraveling the day I left my childhood home. 

This morning, as I fold the laundry, I watch _Puinhoop_, a terrific Dutch documentary by Allard Detiger, who chronicles his experiences caring for his elderly mother who suffers from borderling personality disorder. Ten years worth of footage of reliving trauma, fighting, and trying to get through to a person whose psyche might as well have gotten trapped in concrete. 

Even though I read the description, the experience of watching it hits me like a train. Adverse childhood experiences make for such an insidious, confusing, and penitent experience of adulthood that sometimes I would've preferred having my arm broken.


It's the message from an old friend on LinkedIn telling me she's proud of me for succeeding despite my childhood, and me needing a week to cry about it. It's skipping church that Sunday because I can't bare a Mother's Day sermon. It's sending Annelie a message ahead of our coffee date to tell her I can't leave until I've cried because I'm good at switching context.
