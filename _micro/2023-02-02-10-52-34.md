Listening to act two of _This American Life_'s episode [The Runaround](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/789/the-runaround/act-two-6), in which we meet a boy who can only really calm his mind by running loops around the block, I can't help but wonder: it's beautiful to see a young problem-solver with ADHD make life easier for himself, but were there other people who thought of the compensatory behaviors often displayed by people with an eating disorder?
