If you still needed convincing that I'm Grandma Tech at home, struggling to use even the most straightforward of functionalities, please be aware that I was today years old when I learned that, five years ago, [TextExpander released a custom iOS keyboard](https://textexpander.com/blog/textexpander-tip-try-our-ios-keyboard-and-one-tap-text-snippet-keys) that would've solved so many of my mundane problems, and all I was doing was asking myself "why am I even paying for that app anymore?"
