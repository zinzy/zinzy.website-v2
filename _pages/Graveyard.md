Inspired by a [few](https://robhope.com/graveyard) [good](https://www.danielzarick.com/failed/) [people](), I maintain an overview of projects in which I've been involved. I love personal websites that aren't just a highlight reel of someone's life, but that instead give a glimpse into someone's actual life. The projects below were all part of my life at one point or another. If you'd like to learn more about them, [get in touch](/hello).

### 🎙️ Shutting up with God (2021)
A podcast about prayer on which I wanted to interview people that would remind the listener that Christianity is not a heteronormative monolith. I was looking forward to cohosting this with my friend Mary. Career opportunities got in the way of the project.

### 🎙️ 7 Things That Make Me Feel Guilty (2021)
A podcast on which I would interview queer Catholics about things that make them feel guilty. Originated with the idea that learning about each other's vulnerabilities is a great way to see ourselves in others. I recorded a first season with a well-received pilot, but life got in the way and I never ended up releasing the episodes. 

### ☕ Manifold (2019)
An Amsterdam Meetup for queer Christians of color. They were hard to find.

### 📚 QPOC Reading Club (2018-2019)
An Amsterdam Meetup for queer people of colors that gathered once a month to discuss an antiracist, queer-friendly text.

### ✌🏽 #asocialcall (2020)
A little branded initiative I started on Instagram to keep up people's spirits when the pandemic broke out. Consisted of people using the hashtag `#asocialcall` to find strangers to have short Zoom calls with.

### ✊🏽 Inclusive Workspace (2019 - 2020)
Frustrated by a sudden burst of straight White people changing their careers to consultancy in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), I created a platform to showcase the many (queer) people of color I know who already excel at this work. Things were going well, and then there was Covid.

### ✏️ WTF Bible (2013)
A domain name I registered on a whim which I would use to blog about weird things I found in the Bible. There were too many things and I didn't know where to begin.

### 📰 Unnamed journalistic platform (2013)
After being approached by a team of young journalists, I worked on a platform to bring investigative journalism to a younger audience. In the Autumn of the year, [De Correspondent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Correspondent) was launched.

### 🧑🏽‍🏫 De Webtraining (2011 - 2014)
Together with a friend, I developed a series of workshops to teach young business owners how to use the Internet to their advantage.

### 📰 BOMBOMMER (2010 - 2013)
A university buddy and I ran this fairly successful absurdist student magazine.

### ✏️ Huis van Jis (2010)
Together with a friend and a roommate, I wrote a fictional letter exchange between three college friends.
