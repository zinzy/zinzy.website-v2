Inspired by [Matthew Smith](https://matthewsmith.website/portfolio), my initial use of the _Then_ concept was as an archive of my Now page. These days, it functions more as [Piper Haywood's Work page](https://piperhaywood.com/work-background/) does: as a story of how I got to [Now](/now). Together, they make up the about page that I can never seem to finish.

### I come from a long line of reluctantly-Catholic, loud, burgundian band geeks
In the Deep Dutch South, I learned to embrace the health benefits of making music, the forests of the German border, and the importance of charcuterie.

To account for the accent with which I speak English, I always tell people that Oprah was the only Black woman I knew growing up. It's funny, sad, it's true.

I've always had a knack for languages, though: learning how to read, write, and speak them (usually in that order), and later, how to command them into stories that nurture conversations.

### I suppose that's why I went on to study the letters
At Utrecht University, I dove head-first into literature and linguistics, specializing in narratology and comics studies, and running the absurdist student magazine BOMBOMMER. I graduated with a thesis on focalization in the comicized Dutch classic _The Evenings_.

### I've been building things for the web since there were still five Spice Girls
Somehow I ended up with a degree in literature and linguistics. How is this all connected, you ask? Well, [naming things](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/12/23/UPI), of course. Parallel to my hopes of becoming a humanities PhD, I had been running a design studio since I was 18. Back then, building sites and helping out startups was an easy way to make money. Eventually, it'd come to mean [more than just that](/work).

The imposter syndrome self-taught designers and researchers may feel resonates very, very deeply with me. It was until 13 years in that I began feeling like a proper designer. I've found, though, that there is something very beautiful and effective in learning by solving your own problems. I suppose that's also very much my learning style.

### Speaking of learning styles, I'm neurodivergent
My understanding of how I work and what that means for my life is on a seemingly never-ending journey. Unlike what people often think when they meet me, I wasn't blessed with a dust-free school career. I was put on the fast track for mathematics at age seven, but got bored and fannied my way through elementary school, wondering why I was so different.

At my edtech employer Leeruniek I always joked that I was the only person at the company who had experienced all levels of the [Dutch educational system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_Netherlands). My high school and college experiences were so deeply drenched in underachievement that putting them on LinkedIn would make me entirely unhireable.

Luckily though, I eventually made it to university, where I found the pace that was right for me.
