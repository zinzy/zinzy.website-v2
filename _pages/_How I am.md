This page doesn't detail how I conduct my professional affairs[^1], but rather an overview of some of the things that drive me, and what they mean for the way I relate to the people around me and the environments in which I appear.








I'm a senior-but-silly User Experience researcher and designer specializing in what UX can do in the enterprise SaaS space. With a cross-industry mindset, I'm currently in healthcare technology.

## How I work: curiously, laterally, impatiently
In my working life, the biggest contribution to my happiness and productivity has been learning to embrace my [neurodivergence](https://giftedquest.com/what-is-giftedness). 

### Follow the intensity
I let intense curiosity, rapid learning, overexcitability, and lateral thinking lead the way towards projects I take on at work. Usually this drives me towards whatever challenge is the biggest obstacle at the moment.

#### Habitless productivity
My executive disfunctions make it difficult to build habits. Instead of struggling to put something new in place, I trust my intrinsic motivation to tell me where to go, removing obstacles along the way.

#### Unblock, then unlock
With the two points above, you might think I'm the worst loose canon anyone could ever hire. The reason I get anything of value done at all is because my strongest motivator is the stability that comes with people trusting me to do good work. Tasks that unblock colleagues are the first things I cross off my to do list in the morning. After that, I discover, play, question, doodle, venture, make mistakes, and learn.

#### Just enough research and design
I don't like to spend time on things that are not needed. I never design a pixel-perfect prototype if a doodle suffices. I don't research for the sake of research. Deliverables are things that move a project forward and mitigate risk, nothing more, nothing less.

#### Laziness
Here's Bill Gates talking about me:
