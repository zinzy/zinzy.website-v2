I'm an advocate for the IndieWeb because I believe in an Internet that is decentralized, open, available, and whimsical. In one way or another, this space has been publicly available since 1998. Consider it a quiet street on the Internet, a place for soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. Thank you for your time.

I'm an amateur writer, an avid musician, and a swimmer. During office hours, I'm a researcher and designer specialized in making tools for people at work. I currently serve as Senior UXer at [Gerimedica](https://gerimedica.nl), a market leader in medical technology. Despite being academically trained in comparative literature and theology, I've been an IT professional my entire adult life.
