Heya pal, glad you're here! I'm Zinzy, a human, former band geek, and curious baker from Amsterdam. This is a quiet street on the Internet where I come to learn in public and change my mind. What about you?

The best way to get to know me is by meeting with me personally. If you're in the neighborhood, feel free to come say [hello](/hello). A good alternative is to look around on this website. You can start by reading more [about me](/about).

On this website I share soft stances, lived experience, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. This website goes back to 2009. Sometimes, I dig up old gems from my personal archive and add them to the site. Read [my diary](/diary).

Having taught myself web development in my nineties Spice Girls bedroom, I'm a UX designer and researcher specialized in making tools for people at work. Learn more about [what I do](/work).
