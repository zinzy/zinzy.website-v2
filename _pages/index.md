Heya internet pal, welcome to my website. Consider it a quiet street on the Internet; a place for soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. I appreciate that you chose to visit this place. Thank you for your time.

<!-- I'm a human in Amsterdam and I like to write, draw, and make music. During office hours, I'm a Senior UX researcher and designer in medical technology. I'm an advocate for the IndieWeb because I believe in an Internet that is decentralized, open, available, and whimsical. In one way or another, this space has been publicly available since 1998. -->
