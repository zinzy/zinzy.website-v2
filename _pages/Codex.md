Inspired by [Buster Benson's _Codex_](https://busterbenson.com/beliefs/), [Greg Clarke](https://gregology.net/codex/), [Elliott Cost's _Opinions_](http://web.archive.org/web/20220123045740/https://elliott.computer/pages/opinion) and others I'm using this page to grow[^1] a record of things I believe.

### Terms of use

#### If you're Zinzy
No human experience can ever be summed up in a list of bullet points. Nevertheless, the things below you have written in earnest. Look at them whenever you need a reminder of what's important to you.

#### If you're someone else
Feel free to read, learn, wonder, and remember:
- Statements below apply to me, and to me only, even though their phrasing is often general
- This is an unapologetic codex, in which I may say things that offend your sensibilities, simply because of the person I am. You are not me, you may disagree with me. That's okay. Make your own codex!
- These things may be subject to change. 

### The codex

#### Chapter 0: Meta beliefs
- Opinions, beliefs, and values may change over time
- I am ignorant and see only a very small fraction of reality from my own [[Standpoint theory|standpoint]]

#### Chapter 1: Self
- I am an optimist
- I make mistakes 
- My intuition will always be able to lead the way
- My emotions are my responsibility (Gregology)
- My beliefs and principles may change and that's okay 
- My questions are relevant
- I'm great at finding connections with others 
- At heart I'm a cultural relativist
- I'm privileged because:
	- I have no serious, untreatable physical disabilities 
	- I live in a North-West European country with solid infrastructure, excellent health care, and good education opportunities, where I mostly feel safe and free presenting as queer with my partner
	- My partner and I are invested in our relationship, share the same values, and have succeeded at cohabitating so far
	- I have close friendships with White people who are fiercely antiracist
- I lack privilege because:
	- I'm a first-generation university graduate, and I was not at all prepared for what academic life would bring
	- I cannot safely travel to certain countries with my partner
	- There are church communities that I cannot join because of the color of my skin, my gender identity, or my sexual orientation.

#### Chapter 2: Spirituality and philosophy
- The Bible is too complex to be taken literally.
- God is easiest to find in nature.
- Orthopraxy trumps orthodoxy.
- Christian culture is too much about what we should believe and too little about what we should do
- Jesus is not my savior, but my teacher.
- Jesus' physical resurrection, ascension into heaven, his virgin birth or position as the son of God are irrelevant to my faith.

#### Chapter 3: People & relationships
- People try to do what they think will make the world a better place.
- Strangers don't often expect kindness. It can be a spark for a great friendship.
- Everybody's lives are infinitely complex, vulnerable, precious, and potential, just like mine.
- White isn't a color unless it's a skin color
- Seeing yourself in other people is crucial to developing a healthy sense of self
- No adult person should be forced to carry on a relationship with family members. 
- Some people shouldn't have children.
- Sometimes, going no contact with a parent is the least damaging option.
- Everyone has their own way of saying "I love you"

#### Chapter 4: Culture, society, and media

- Seeing your experiences and standpoint reflected in media is crucial to developing a healthy sense of self
- It's good to have one website as your central point of communication with the Internet
- To learn about a group of people, look at the stories they tell themselves and others
- History is told by the winner, and sometimes by the loudest

#### Chapter 5: Politics and policies
- No political system is flawless, some are worse than others
- Both revolution and evolution are required for change
- Ones politics cannot be seen separatedly from ones character and conduct. Sometimes, it's not possible to "engage with someone despite your different views", because of the implications those views have

#### Chapter 6: Health & Wellbeing
- Diet culture is dangerous
- Eating disorders are not about food

#### Chapter 7: Learning
- Discomfort is where growth happens

#### Chapter 8: Work
- Praise in public, criticize in private
- Don't work overtime unless required
