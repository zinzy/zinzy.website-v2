Inspired by both [Buster Benson's _Codex_](https://busterbenson.com/codex) and [Elliott Cost's _Opinions_](https://elliott.computer/pages/opinion/) I'm using this page to grow a record of things I believe.

- **If you're Zinzy:** use this page as a reference point, to remind yourself of what life really is about to you. These things may be subject to change.
- **If you're someone else:** feel free to read and learn, and remember that you're not Zinzy, and you may disagree with her. That's okay. Take this permission slip to make your own codex! These things may be subject to change.

## Chapter 1: Self
- I am an optimist
- I make mistakes
- I am ignorant and see only a very small fraction of reality from my own standpoint
- My intuition will always be able to lead the way
- [My emotions and feelings are my responsibility](https://gregology.net/codex/)
- My beliefs and principles may change and that's okay 
- My questions are relevant
- I'm great at finding connections with others 
- I'm a cultural relativist
- I'm comfortable as long as I have an escape hatch
- I'm privileged because I have no serious, untreatable physical disabilities 
- I'm privileged because I live in North-Western Europe
- I'm privileged because I live in a country with solid infrastructure, excellent health care, and good education opportunities
- I'm privileged because I feel safe and free presenting as queer with my partner
- I'm privileged because My partner and I are invested in our relationship
- I'm privileged because I have close friendships with White people who are fiercely antiracist

## Chapter 2: Other
- Every person tries to do what they think will make the world a better place
- Sudden kindness can spark a great friendship
- White isn't a color unless it's a skin color
- Everybody's lives are infinitely complex, vulnerable, precious, and potential, just like mine
- No person should be forced to carry on a relationship with a family member
- Some people should be child-free
- Sometimes, going no-contact with a parent is the least damaging option
- Connection is the fuel of life
- Development aid, no matter how benevolent, is a flawed and belittling effort by definition
- To learn about a group of people, look at the stories they tell themselves and others
- Pay for someone else or split the tab then and there. Don't keep tabs of who owes what to whom 
- Seeing yourself in other people is crucial to developing a healthy sense of self

---

### Chapter 3: Culture
- Seeing your experiences and reality reflected in media is crucial to developing a healthy sense of self
- Silly archives are crucial tools for cultural analysis
- History is told by the winner, and sometimes by the loudest
- People in their early- to mid-thirties should have access to Pok√©mon Red on a floppy disk, as well as a device on which to play it

## Chapter 4: Habits
- Yin yoga trains tolerance of discomfort
- Meditation is not about maintaining but regaining your focus
- Wash your face every day, and moisturize properly
- Buy simple black t-shirts and wear one every day
- Politics are not separate from life. Some political views may have implications that are unacceptable for me
- Ironing is a calming activity

---

### Chapter 5: Spirituality & philosophy
- I believe in God
- The 'Judeo-Christian tradition' is a harmful and unnecessary invention of Christianity
- Humans are a part of nature
- Religion is a gorgeously complex creation of humans to communicate about and with an existing something that they'll never be able to fathom, harness, or identify
- The Bible is too complex to be taken literally

---

## Chapter 6: Learning
- Discomfort is sometimes where growth happens

## Chapter 7: Making & work
- It's good to have one website as your central point of communication with the Internet
- Use one notebook for everything

---
 
## Chapter 8: Tips
- _Halloween_ is the best horror movie franchise, in the very first place because of the blatant disregard the films have for one another.

---

## Chapter 9: Things I no longer believe
- ~~Any problem can be solved by a good book~~
- ~~Everything can be systemized~~
