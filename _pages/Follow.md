I personally love visiting other people's personal websites to discover whether they've updated anything since I was last there. Usually, I'm pleasantly surprised by a new port, or a typographic change. A good way to keep track of all these websites is by using an RSS reader.

## What is RSS?
I couldn't explain it better than [Matt Webb](https://aboutfeeds.com/).

## How to follow this website
This website has two feeds: 
- [Feed.xml](/feed.xml) will keep you updated on all of the new diary entries I publish
- [Micro.xml](/micro.xml) will hopefully soon let post to this website and syndicate it to Mastodon
