I grew up on the Internet in a time when social media meant writing comments on other people's hand-built blogs. I remember a sense of whimsy, endless curiosity, and a beautiful lack of information overload. It instilled in me a deep appreciation for hand-crafted websites. This is one of them.

### Principles
I believe things on the web should be accessible, transparent, and sustainable. This website is inspired by [Brutalist web design principles](https://brutalist-web.design/), [The a11y project](https://www.a11yproject.com/), [Designed to last](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/), [Sadness' internet Manifesto](https://sadgrl.online/cyberspace/internet-manifesto), and others.

### What I put on here
As an adult person with hobbies, a career, and various interests, and lived experiences, I routinely wonder what I should put on my website, what I should leave out, what style of design I should implement and why. What does this space say about my person? What does it say about my skills as a professional designer? This I know: I believe it's good to have a single website that serves as my home on the web. I also believe that it's okay to use this space to be vulnerable, lack awareness, and change my mind.


### Design
Currently this website sports a brutalist single-column design. It's a humble form of activism of mine to combat the pressure my fellow UX designers and I feel about personal branding. I love narrow, single-column personal websites. They tell me: "hey, I'm just a person like you, and this is a way for you to get to know me a bit better. All you have to do is knock, I'll always open the door." I truly hope this website invokes a similar vibe for you. I usually refrain from using custom CSS or content in my diary entries.

### Privacy
Much like you, I assume, I don't like being tracked on the Internet. There would be countless things I could learn from having analytics running on this website, but since quantitative analysis is a solid part of my day job, I like to keep the mystery alive in my private affairs.
