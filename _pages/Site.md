title: "About this website"
layout: page
---
I grew up on the Internet in a time when social media meant writing comments on other people's hand-built blogs. I remember a sense of whimsy, endless curiosity, and a beautiful lack of information overload. It instilled in me a deep appreciation for hand-crafted websites. This is one of them.

### Principles
I believe things on the web should be <mark>accessible, transparent, and sustainable</mark>. In making this website, I do my best to keep in mind the following sources of inspiration:

- [Brutalist web design principles](https://brutalist-web.design/)
- [The a11y project](https://www.a11yproject.com/)
- [Designed to last](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/)
- [Sadness' internet Manifesto](https://sadgrl.online/cyberspace/internet-manifesto)

### The story this space tells
One element about web publishing that has forever been intriguing me is the question of online identity. As an adult person with hobbies, a career, and various interests, I routinely wonder what I should put on my website, what I should leave out, what style of design I should implement and why. What does this space say about my person? What does it say about my skills as a professional designer?

When it comes down to it, this I know: I believe it's good to have a single website that serves as my home on the web rather than separate websites for my professional and personal lives. I also believe that it's okay to use this space to be vulnerable, lack awareness, and change my mind.

### Content
There are three main content types on this website:
- Journal entries, some fleeting, some crafted with great focus, all of which are collected under [Writing](/writing)
- Short blurbs, reflections, reminders, and notes to friends, which I store in [my changelog](/changelog)
- Working notes of topics I think about frequently, collected in [my garden](/garden)

### Design
Currently this website sports a brutalist single-column design. It's a humble form of activism of mine to combat the pressure my fellow UX designers and I feel about personal branding. 

I love narrow, single-column personal websites. They tell me: "hey, I'm just a person like you, and this is a way for you to get to know me a bit better. All you have to do is knock, I'll always open the door." I truly hope this website invokes a similar vibe for you.

I usually refrain from using custom CSS or content in my diary entries.

### Privacy
Much like you, I assume, I don't like being tracked on the Internet. There would be countless things I could learn from having analytics running on this website, but since quantitative analysis is a solid part of my day job, I like to keep the mystery alive in my private affairs.
