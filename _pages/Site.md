I grew up on the Internet in a time when social media meant writing comments on other people's hand-built blogs. The sense of whimsy, endless curiosity, and a beautiful lack of information overload are highs I have been chasing ever since. It instilled in me a deep appreciation for a small-scale, intimate, and friendly internet made up of hand-crafted websites. This is one of them.

Iâ€™ve been yelling at Internet clouds since 1997.

### Principles
- This is a [motherfucking website](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/)
- It follows [brutalist web design principles](https://brutalist-web.design/) 
- It is [designed to last](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/)
- It is inspired by [Sadness' internet Manifesto](https://sadgrl.online/cyberspace/internet-manifesto)
- It will hopefully one day be properly [accessible](accessibility)

### What I put on here
- I have one website detailing my personal and professional interests and endeavors
- This space accepts my vulnerability, lack of awareness, and change of heart
- It consists mostly of English language text

### Technical details

- It makes use of [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Yellow Lab Tools](https://yellowlab.tools/result/got2ipv3ap) gives this site a 100/100 global score
