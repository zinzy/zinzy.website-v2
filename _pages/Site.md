I grew up on the Internet in a time when social media meant building your own photo blog. This instilled in me a deep appreciation for hand-crafted websites. This is one of them.

## Technical details
A full overview of the nerdiest things about this website can be found in my [humans.txt](/humans.txt) file.

## Writing
Much of what I learn and think works best for me if I connect it to existing ideas in some way. I do so either in a paper notebook, or in my Obsidian vault. If I want to make any of it suitable for public consumption, I go into Visual Studio Code, edit a Markdown file, and push it to Github.

This website no longer supports continuous deployment of a content repository. It used to update hourly with any changes I was making to my actual personal knowledge management system. [I found that wasn't working for me](https://tech.lgbt/@zinzy/109762215863198767).

## Design
The layout, color scheme, typography, and general user interface of this website are simple. It fits with my aesthetics, and it works particularly well for the portfolio part of my website, which is colorful enough in itself.

I love narrow, single-column personal websites. They tell me: "hey, I'm just a person like you, and this is a way for you to get to know me a bit better. All you have to do is knock, I'll always open the door." I truly hope this website invokes a similar vibe for you.

## Privacy
Much like you, I assume, I don't like being tracked on the Internet. There would be countless things I could learn from having analytics running on this website, but since quantitative analysis is a solid part of my day job, I like to keep the mystery alive in my private affairs. [I don't track you, but others might](https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2020/01/i-dont-track-you-here-but-others-might/).
