This is a [Now](https://nownownow.com/) page. It contains what I'd tell a friend I hadn't seen in a year. You should make one for yourself.

### Life
I'm living in [Amsterdam](/amsterdam)'s Indische buurt with my partner [Anja Waleson](https://anjawaleson.notion.site/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55), a high school English teacher and new ceramicist. We share a little shoebox with a petit garden. In February we welcomed home our corgi puppy Lemonade, who may or may not have her own blog, [let's find out together](https://lemonade.waleson.us).

Anja and I made a change to how we handle our birthdays: instead of receiving individuals gifts from friends and family, we host a mini crowdfunding to raise money for a specific goal. In December, after three decades of longing, I finally bought a piano. I am in love with it, and I've been practicing technique and songs ever since.

### Work
I hinted at this in my [week 11 weeknotes](2023/03/26/week-11/), but I'm very pleased to say I'm starting a new career adventure. After 2.5 years with the wonderful team of [Leeruniek](https://leeruniek.nl/) I'm joining [Gerimedica](https://gerimedica.nl/) in May. I knew when I joined Leeruniek that I'd eventually make the jump to medical technology, and I can't think of a better landing spot than Gerimedica.

There's so much work that goes into applying for a new design job, and I haven't been very vocal about it on here. Stay tuned for a more in-depth post about this process as well as my thoughts about this next move.
