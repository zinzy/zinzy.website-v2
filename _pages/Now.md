This is a [Now](https://nownownow.com/) page. It contains what I'd tell a friend I hadn't seen in a year. I'm using it as a casual version of an about page. You should make a Now page for yourself.

### I live on Amsterdam's East side with Anja and Lemonade
Since 2016 I've been living in [Amsterdam](/amsterdam)'s Indische buurt with my partner [Anja Waleson](https://anjawaleson.notion.site/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55), a high school English teacher and new potter. We share a little shoebox with a petit garden. [In February we welcomed home our corgi puppy Lemonade](/2023/03/08/two-weeks-with-a-dog/), who may or may not have her own blog, [let's find out together](https://lemonade.waleson.us).

### I make an effort to enjoy hobbies outside of work
Recently, Anja and I made a change to how we handle our birthdays: instead of receiving individuals gifts from friends and family, we host a mini crowdfunding to raise money for a specific goal. In December, after three decades of longing, I finally bought a piano. I am in love with it, and I've been practicing technique and songs ever since.

I'm looking forward to the local outdoor pool opening up again so I can go for my 6:30AM morning swims. I've missed swimming plenty over the winter, and it might be smart to find a good indoor pool for the later months of 2023. For now, I'm pleased to know that Amsterdam's finest outdoor pool is in our own backyard.

### I'm joining medtech scaleup Gerimedica in May 
I hinted at this in recent [weeknotes](2023/03/26/week-11/), but I'm very pleased to say I'm starting a new career adventure. After 2.5 years with the wonderful team of [Leeruniek](https://leeruniek.nl/) I'm joining [Gerimedica](https://gerimedica.nl/) in May. I knew when I joined Leeruniek that I'd eventually make the jump to medical technology, and I can't think of a better landing spot than Gerimedica.

At Leeruniek, I fell deeply in love with impact-driven product development. My new manager at Gerimedica told me during my hiring process that their goal is to help people spend less time in their product, and I absolutely _love_ that. I'm looking forward to contributing what I can.

### I'm mentoring again
After a hiatus, I'm pleased to be back on the mentoring market. With 16 years of professional experience, I've found that my stories, many of which I had always deemed irrelevant to the world, can be of help to other people in the IT industry, specifically UX designers and researchers and product managers. If you'd like to book a session with me, you may do so via [ADPList](https://adplist.org/mentors/zinzy-nev-geene).

### I'm doing my best to accept the ebb and flow of life
One of the thinking traps in which I routinely fall is the one where "Y can happen when X is completed". We make a plan and God laughs. I've found that meditation helps me break this cycle. I've been devoting time daily to a meditation session. It's becoming easier to remember that even 10 minutes of practice is worthwhile, even when I keep comparing myself to monks on some Tibetan mountain.

### I'm learning how to be kind to my neurodivergent brain
Through trial and error, I'm finding ways to help myself best learn and deliver. One thing that's been helpful in this regard is accepting my tendency to think top-down rather than bottom-up. It's marvellous to see how much of the world assumes a bottom-up approach to learning, communicating, and creating. YouTuber [Elizabeth Filips](https://www.youtube.com/@elizabethfilips) has been of great help on this journey.
