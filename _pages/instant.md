In 2023 a childhood dream of mine came true: I purchased my very first instant camera, a Polaroid Now+. In the mid 00s, when Polaroid's bankruptcy was causing a run on instant film, was when I first became interested in photography. I had serious envy of people like [Rachel James](https://web.archive.org/web/20080811190236/http://www.aandedijk.com/), [Gayla Trail](http://www.makinghappy.com/), and [Heather Powazek Champ](https://web.archive.org/web/20050420005925/http://www.hchamp.com/) who were keeping instant photography blogs.

Now, I finally get to explore the world of instant film, one potential screw-up at a time. While I archive all my photographs on this website, a number of them have been blurred because the subjects wish to not be featured.
