The red thread in my life is bottomless curiosity for the world in which we live. I've learnt to embrace the fact that some of my hobbies come and go, and know that there are topics I love that have been with me for decades.

### Music
Hailing from a long line of band geeks, I got my first toy piano at age four, and I haven't been the same since. I know my way around most wind and percussion instruments, and developed a keen relationship first with the trumpet and the oboe, then the guitar, and now, finally, the piano. Making music is the single most effective tool in my mental health toolkit.

### Linguistics
I was academically trained as a linguist and literary theorist and was on a path to a career in comics studies before making a pivot towards design. Languages still hold a place in my heart, and I often use language learning as a way to relax and keep me on my toes. Currently, I'm diving into Korean, and enjoying it thoroughly.
