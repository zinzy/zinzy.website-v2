I reserve a portion of my time to (remotely) mentor researchers and designers. I do this because I find gratification in helping others navigate paths with which I'm familiar. An added bonus is that it helps me keep a pulse on how the tech industry is developing. I've been doing this since around 2013. 

<mark>Good to know: I'm currently on hiatus from mentoring. If you'd like to be reminded when I start back up again, feel free to sign up for my newsletter.</mark>

## Me as a mentor
Here's a short overview of who you'll be speaking with:

- I have **16 years** of experience making digital products
- I'm a **self-taught** designer
- I overcome **imposter syndrome** every day
- My academic background is in media studies, **language** and theology
- I organize people around design as a **service**
- I like to push mentees outside of their **comfort zone**

## Where I can help

- **User advocacy:** I can help you navigate office politics and stakeholder management as you work to be a calm, sincere, not-to-be-messed-with voice for the people who are not in the room.
- **Interdisciplinary collaboration:** By letting you focus on individuals over processes, I can help you learn new ways of communicating in a timely and effective way inside and outside of your team.
- **Inclusivity and diversity:** as a queer person of color with a background in facilitation, I can give you tools to be a colleague who makes people feel belonging, professionally and socially.
- **DesignOps and ResearchOps:** I can help you explore how a more strategic way of looking at operations can benefit the work you do and the result your team produces.
- **Strategy:** Separating the buzzwords from the best practices, I can help you enhance your strategic thinking, and develop the tools you use to communicate about it.

## Why I mentor
These days, you can find me on [ADPList](https://adplist.org/mentors/zinzy-nev-geene), but my efforts originated on my /mentoring page, following [Diana Kimball Berlin](https://dianaberlin.com/), originator of a distributed mentoring movement:


> Every major step forward in my life so far has been inspired and encouraged by the mentors I’ve been fortunate enough to have. I believe that hopes, dreams, and advice are best shared in ongoing, personal relationships, and it’s important to me to make myself available as a mentor to others."
