I maintain this page as an incomplete overview of the things I love to use. Kind of like [Uses This](https://usesthis.com/), but they haven't requested an interview yet. Before you dive in, please know that I believe (and tell myself in the mirror that) tools don't matter. I don't list all the tools I use (you don't care that I have an iPhone), just the ones I think you might find useful.

## Hardware 
- [WH-1000XM4 Wireless Premium Noise Canceling Headphones](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/headphones/headband/p/wh1000xm4-b) have kept me sane working from home in the same room as a high school teacher
- [Cubix Round Zip Box Pen Case in black](https://www.jetpens.com/Cubix-Round-Zip-Box-Pen-Case-Black/pd/14514) fits all of the writing and drawing utensils I use on a given day
- [Swapfiets Power 7](https://swapfiets.nl/bikes/power-7?city=amsterdam) is what I use to bike Amsterdam. It's a bit of a splurge, but money well spent

## Kitchen
- [Le Creuset's silicone spatulas](https://www.lecreuset.com/kitchen-tools/spoons-and-spatulas) facilitate my need to leave nothing behind in any pan, pot, jar, or bowl. The small ones are best.
- [Karasu Knives](https://karasu-knives.com/) is a boutique in Amsterdam run by our "knife guy"

## Wear
- [Nike Sportswear RPM Waistpack](https://www.nike.com/nl/en/t/sportswear-rpm-waistpack-CNTh3z/CQ3817-010): I am one of those people who doesn't like a large day pack, and this fanny pack (the belt of which works for my body) is a great alternative.
- [Polette](https://www.polette.com/nl) manufactures my glasses
- [Mascolori](https://mascolori.eu/men/shoes/pointed-toe) makes some of my favorite Oxford shoes

## Wellbeing
- [Nidra Deep Rest Eye Mask with Nosepiece](https://nidragoods.com/collections/sleep-mask-collection/products/nidra-deep-rest-eye-mask-black): I love being able to have my eyes open while I'm wearing a sleep mask, and this lets me do just that. I use this when I'm having trouble falling asleep, and won't stop looking at my phone.
- [Medoes Sleep Mask](https://www.bol.com/nl/nl/p/medoes-luxe-slaapmasker-vrouwen-kinderen-mannen-100-verduisterend/9200000118817210): if I'm very tired and need to get to sleep right away, this mask does the trick.

## Indispensable software
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)
- [BetterSleep](https://www.bettersleep.com/): I've been using this app since it was still called Relax Melodies. As someone who [hears things loudly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperacusis), I've been able to significantly improve my experiences in the outside world. I love the fact that I can mix together various sounds.
