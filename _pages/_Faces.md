These are some of the faces that have made an appearance somewhere on this website. Some of them I've never met in person, others aren't even human. But they're all relationships I've come to appreciate.

As you'll see, some of the images are blurred. These are photographs of friends who are part of the queer community, and who left their countries of origin to live life in a more open environment.
