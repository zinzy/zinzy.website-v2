### Today
Since May 2023 I've been at [Gerimedica](https://gerimedica.nl), a market-leading software provider in the Dutch healthcare space. I take a Ted Lasso approach to building products: I care little about my job title, and a lot about whatever activity will help us solve problems more effectively.

### Why enterprise SaaS
In the years I've spent getting paid to make digital products I've learnt one thing: I like a good challenge. Tools built for people at work are usually highly specialized, are behind on best design practices, and are often created to appeal to the buyer (a company), not the user (an employee).

The intricacies of enterprise SaaS products, and the endurance and creativity they require of their makers are what I need to feel excited about my work.




### My practice
Over the past two decades, my practice as a researcher and designer has radically evolved. Much of this I thank to developing a keener understanding of what it means to be the type of neurodivergent that I am. The following has accelerated my productivity. 

#### Habitless productivity
I do not actively attempt to build better habits into my work routine.  Rather, I trust my body and instincts to tell me what to do, finding ways to unblock those habits I intrinsically lean towards.

#### Chaotic passion
I let intense curiosity, rapid learning, hyperfocus, and lateral thinking lead the way towards projects I take on at work.

#### Unblock, then unlock
The reason I get anything of value done at all is because the thing that motivates me strongest is the stability and freedom that come with people trusting me to do good work. Tasks that unblock product owners and developers are the first things I cross off my to do list in the morning. After that, I discover, play, question, make mistakes, and learn.

#### Just enough research and design
I take a strategic approach to engaging in research and design work. I never design more than a developer of prototype needs, and I research just enough to get past the hurdle of risky assumptions.

#### Laziness
The previous paragraph can also be expressed by Bill Gates:

> [I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/568877-i-choose-a-lazy-person-to-do-a-hard-job)





### What I believe to be true




There are a few ideas that I live by

#### Product designers should do research

#### Product designers should think strategically


#### Praise in public, criticize in private


### What I do

Tactical UX research and design
: I don't do UX for the sake of it, but instead deploy my [[UX toolkit]] to solve a wide variety of problems that may exist at companies making digital products.

Enterprise SaaS
: Products that fascinate me are usually complex, data-heavy tools used by people to solve problems at work.

Impact-driven teams
: I love products that contribute to making the world a better place. More practically, I enjoy contributing specifically to those products that amplify and simplify the jobs of essential workers.
