Heya, I'm Zinzy, and I’ve been yelling at Internet clouds since 1997.

To learn about the story of who I am today, please visit my [Now](/now) page. To discover how I got here, head over to [Then](/then). This (growing) about page is one of a technical, factual nature.

- I call myself an Afropean, because my father is São Toméan and my mother is Dutch
- I am non-binary, and my pronouns are she / they
- I hold a degree in Dutch language and linguistics from Utrecht University
- I felt called to ministry, but dropped out of VU seminary
- I am in my mid-thirties
- I'm neurodivergent
- I live in Amsterdam's Indische Buurt
- I am an orthoprax Jesus follower operating in the venn diagram of the Episcopal Church, [Lab/Shul](https://www.labshul.org/), and Catholicism
- My life story contains a number of adverse childhood experiences which resulted in a long-term eating disorder as well as substance abuse issues
- I'm <span id="sobriety"></span> sober, and I'm in recovery from my eating disorder
