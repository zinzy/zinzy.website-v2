I am a person, researcher, designer, and facilitator living and working in Amsterdam.

Currently, I'm a senior-but-silly designer at [Gerimedica](https://gerimedica.nl), where I do my best to establish a more user-centered approach to product development. I'm specialized in building enterprise SaaS products, and couldn't think of a better way to spend my working life.

I share my life with [Anja Waleson](https://anjawaleson.notion.site/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55), who is dynamite. Together, we're companions to corgi puppy Lemonade, who may or may not have her own blog ([let's find out together](https://lemonade.waleson.us/)). I don't like dogs. I don't know how I got here.

I'm an orthoprax Christian who likes Jesus as a teacher-not-savior. I'm non-binary, Afropean, and neurodivergent. I'm childfree and delighted about it. I've been sober since May 2018.
