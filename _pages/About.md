I’ve been yelling at Internet clouds since 1997. In my Spice Girls-themed bedroom, I taught myself how to build websites. I haven’t been the same since.

At some point during this journey, making things for the Internet became my profession. Perhaps you'd like to learn more about my [work](/work) or about this [site](/site).

I come from a long line of reluctantly-Catholic, burgundian band geeks. In the Deep Dutch South, I learned to embrace the health benefits of making music, the forests of the German border, and the importance of charcuterie.

These days, I live in Amsterdam's finest neighborhood, de Indische Buurt. There, I share a shoebox and a petit garden with my partner [Anja](https://anjawaleson.notion.site/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55). We're [child-free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_childlessness), and recently welcomed home our puppy Lemonade (who may or may not have a blog, [let's find out together](https://lemonade.waleson.us/){:target="_blank"}).

To account for the accent with which I speak English, I always tell people that Oprah was the only Black woman I knew growing up. It's funny, and it's true.

I've always had a knack for languages, though: learning how to read, write, and speak them (usually in that order), and later, how to command them into stories that nurture conversations.

I suppose that's why I went on to study the letters. At Utrecht University, I dove head-first into literature and linguistics, specializing in narratology and comics studies, and running the absurdist student magazine BOMBOMMER. I graduated with a thesis on focalization in the comicized Dutch classic _The Evenings_.

Parallel to my hopes of becoming a humanities PhD, I had been running a design studio since I was 18. Back then, building sites and helping out startups was an easy way to make money. Eventually, it'd come to mean [more than just that](/work).

These days, stories and writing are still a big part of my life. This website chronicles the parts of that relationship that are suitable for public consumption.

Because of my experiences and work, honoring people's complex realities is integral to my world view. I'm Afropean, queer, fat, religious, and neurodivergent, and this intersection has shaped my experience of life. It means that _at home_ is a feeling sometimes difficult to come by.

My journey with neurodivergence is long, ramified, and sometimes dead-ended. Now, in my mid-thirties, it's lovely to see how comfortable I'm becoming with how my brain functions and what it can help me do.

In my life, neurodivergence means I'm very curious and eager to learn. It also makes me ask "okay, but why?", sometimes to the chagrin of the people around me.

One of the many breathtaking beauties of Amsterdam is its diversity. When I first moved to the city, I was yearning for a particular type of queer community, and I found one in [Queer Salon](https://meetup.com/queersalon), the monthly slow-paced get together that I founded in 2018.

I'm also a part of the leadership team of [Vine & Fig](https://vineandfig.co/), an international community for queer Catholics. I think there is a very delicate beauty inherent in maintaining a faith practice in an unwelcoming Church. I combine familiar Catholic practices with Taoist teachings in my attempt at being a worthwhile human.

Having originated when I got a keyboard for my fourth birthday, and fully developing in the brass and woodwinds sections of our local orchestra, my passion for music is my leitmotif.

In the orchestra, I was fortunate enough to learn to play most standard-issue wind instruments. In addition, I taught myself to play the guitar, bass guitar, and drums, and even dabbled in the violin while in university.

These days, writing, recording, and making music is a form of meditation for me. The guitar is still my favorite, and I recently began learning to play the piano for real this time.

When I'm not engaging in any of the above, you can find me gardening, doing crossword puzzles, baking, cooking, keeping a diary, wondering how that one actress from that one scene in that one show is doing, perpetually discovering Amsterdam by bike, and enjoying cinema.
