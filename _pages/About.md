Howdy, I'm Zinzy Waleson Geene, and this is my personal website. Consider this a quiet street on the Internet; a place for soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. I'm a fan of the small-scale, intimate, and friendly internet, and [a part of the IndieWeb community](https://indieweb.org/User:Www.zinzy.website). Iâ€™ve been yelling at Internet clouds since 1997.

I share my life with [Anja Waleson](https://anjawaleson.notion.site/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55), who is dynamite. Together, we're companions to corgi puppy Lemonade, who may or may not have her own blog ([let's find out together](https://lemonade.waleson.us/)). I don't like dogs. I don't know how I got here. I do like writing, making music, and instant photography. I'm a swimmer, a cinephile, an urbanite, and a beginning embroiderer. I practice the love language of home cooking. 

I earn a living as a senior-but-silly product researcher and designer. I've been doing this work for 17 years. I'm specialized in making tools for people at work. You can find me at [Gerimedica](https://gerimedica.nl). In what seems like a previous life, I was a linguist and a seminary dropout.

### Some other things about me
- I'm an orthoprax Christian, and I like Jesus because of what I can learn from him, not because he "saved" me
- I'm non-binary, and my pronouns are she/they
- I'm Afropean, born to a Santomean father and a Dutch mother
- I'm neurodivergent, the fast-learning kind with a talent for overengineering
- I'm childfree and could not be more delighted about it
- I've been sober since May 2018
