Hello, I'm Zinzy, and Iâ€™ve been yelling at Internet clouds since 1997. Welcome to my personal website. Consider this a quiet street on the Internet; a place for soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. I'm an advocate of the IndieWeb, which helps us keep the Internet transparent, intimate, and human-centered. I think [you should join us](https://indieweb.org/).

 This website is very much a personal endeavor. You may find me contemplate work challenges, or sharing openly the health struggles I experience because I got a rough start in life. If this resonates with you, feel especially free to [say hello](/hello). I appreciate that you chose to visit this place. Thank you for your time.
