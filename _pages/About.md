### Hello, I'm Zinzy, and Iâ€™ve been yelling at Internet clouds since the mid 90s
Welcome to my personal website. Consider this a quiet street on the Internet; a place for soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. This website is very much a personal endeavor. You'll find that I talk as freely about career challenges as I do personal struggles. I'm an advocate of the IndieWeb, which is to say I love an Internet that is transparent, intimate, and human-centered. If this sounds good to you, you should visit the [IndieWeb wiki](https://indieweb.org/).

### I live, laugh, love, and work in Amsterdam
Together with the absolutely dynamite Anja Waleson I share a shoebox in Amsterdam's finest neighborhood, de Indische Buurt. We're companions to corgi puppy Lemonade, who may or may not have her own blog ([let's find out together](https://lemonade.waleson.us/)). I hate dogs. I don't know how I got here. I enjoy writing, making music, and painting. I practice the love language of home cooking. I'm a swimmer, a cyclist, a cinephile, an urbanite, and a beginning embroiderer.

### I'm a product researcher and designer with 17 years of experience
In May of this year I joined the team at Gerimedica, a healthcare technology provider in Amsterdam. Before that I was at Leeruniek, and before that at Airtrade. I originally cut my teeth running my own design and development practice, Studio Zinzy. What I love about design is that it's a way of looking at the world rather than a skillset involving particular visual design tools. For the past eight years I've been specialized in building tools for people at work.

### Some other things about me
- I'm an orthoprax Christian who is inspired by Jesus as a teacher, not savior
- I'm non-binary, and my pronouns are she/they
- I'm Afropean, hailing from a Santomean father and a Dutch mother
- I'm neurodivergent (the fast-learning kind with a talent for overengineering)
- I'm childfree
- I've been sober since May 2018
