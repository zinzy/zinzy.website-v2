## I'm thinking of moving into UX. Can we chat?
I'm currently taking a break from extracurricular activities, and so I don't have space on my calendar for mentoring. Feel free, however, to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/zinzy). Who knows what the future might have in store for us.

## Can you help me with my personal brand / logo / website?
No. While I enjoyed running my own design studio for eight years, my design efforts these days are geared towards tools that people use at work. I can tell you this, though: [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) and [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/categories/graphics-design) give most people what they need, and if your company name is your name, you don't need a logo.

## Can I interview you for my podcast?
Maybe! I enjoy speaking about my work in design and product, as well as intersectionality, anti-racism, queer Christianity, and what it means to be a queer Afropean Catholic. [Send me an email](/contact) and I'll let you know if I have time.

## Can you write something for me?
Who knows! [Email](/contact) me about your request and let's chat.
