I'm a senior-but-silly designer and researcher with 16 years of experience making digital products. Eight years ago I began to specialize in making tools for people at work.

### What I do

Tactical UX research and design
: I don't do UX for the sake of it, but instead deploy my [[UX toolkit]] to solve a wide variety of problems that may exist at companies making digital products.

Enterprise SaaS
: Products that fascinate me are usually complex, data-heavy tools used by people to solve problems at work.

Impact-driven teams
: I love products that contribute to making the world a better place. More practically, I enjoy contributing specifically to those products that amplify and simplify the jobs of essential workers.

### Availability
I'm currently not available for any new roles or freelance projects, but I do offer free mentoring sessions, so feel free to say [hello](/hello).
