I have 16 years of working experience as a designer, researcher, and mentor making digital products. For the past seven years I've been specializing in making tools for people at work. If you'd like to connect with me professionally, find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zinzy/).

### Accomplishments
- I've led design teams in establishing sustainable UX design and research practices
- I've created a 17-brand design system used by a large suite of consumer and enterprise products 
- I've served users of the country's most popular travel packaging booking platform 
- I've run an absurdist magazine
- I've taught young business owners about the Internet

### Expertise
- **Product and service design:** ignoring design for the sake of design, I love solving business problems by empathizing with users
- **User research:** doing _just enough research_ helps my teams move forward in answering the questions they've been asked
- **Enterprise SaaS:** I love the complexity of digital enterprise products and the teams who make them
