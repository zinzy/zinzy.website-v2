I'm a senior-but-silly UX researcher and designer with 17 years of working experience making digital products. I specialize in enterprise SaaS solutions with social impact. Simply put: I make tools people use to solve problems at work.

### Why enterprise SaaS
In the years I've spent getting paid to make digital products I've learnt one thing: I like a good challenge. Tools built for people at work are usually highly specialized, and embarrassingly behind on modern design practices. They also tend to be created by well-meaning domain experts with limited understanding of user-centered thinking. 

The intricacies of enterprise SaaS products, and the endurance, creativity, and emotional intelligence they require of their makers are what I need to feel excited about my work. Mid-sized companies that hire UX generalists are where I feel most at home.

### My practice
Over the past two decades, my practice as a researcher and designer has radically evolved. Much of this I thank to developing a keener understanding of what it means to be the type of neurodivergent that I am. The following has accelerated my productivity. 

#### Habitless productivity
I do not actively attempt to build better habits into my work routine because I struggle with executive functions.  Rather, I trust my intrinsic motivation to tell me where to go. With regards to habits for which I have a natural tendency, I do my best to make space for them.

#### Chaotic passion
I let intense curiosity, rapid learning, hyperfocus, and lateral thinking lead the way towards projects I take on at work. Usually this drives me towards whatever challenge is the biggest obstacle at the moment.

#### Unblock, then unlock
With the two points above, you might think I'm the worst loose canon anyone could ever hire. The reason I get anything of value done at all is because the thing that motivates me beyond anything else is the stability that comes with people trusting me to do good work.

Tasks that unblock colleagues are the first things I cross off my to do list in the morning. After that, I discover, play, question, doodle, venture, make mistakes, and learn.

#### Just enough research and design
I don't like to spend time on things that are not needed. Rather, I take a tactical approach to deciding what research and design work in which to engage. I never design a pixel-perfect prototype if a doodle suffices. I don't research for the sake of research. Deliverables are things that move a project forward and mitigate risk, nothing more, nothing less.

#### Laziness
Here's Bill Gates talking about me:
