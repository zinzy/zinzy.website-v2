For the past seven years I've been specializing in making tools for people at work. If you'd like to connect with me professionally, find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zinzy/).

## Accomplishments
- I've led design teams in establishing sustainable UX design and research practices
- I've created a 17-brand design system used by a large suite of consumer and enterprise products 
- I've served users of the country's most popular travel packaging booking platform 
- I've run an absurdist magazine
- I've taught young business owners about the Internet

## Expertise
- **Product and service design:** ignoring design for the sake of design, I love solving business problems by empathizing with users
- **User research:** doing _just enough research_ helps my teams move forward in answering the questions they've been asked
- **Enterprise SaaS:** I love the complexity of digital enterprise products and the teams who make them
