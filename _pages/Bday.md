Hey friend, it's Zinzy (welcome to my website)!

If you've been sent here by Anja, it's because she invited you to participate in the annual fundraiser she holds for my birthday. We've been doing this for a while now, and last year you may have contributed to one of the greatest joys in my life: my piano.

Before I tell you about my hopes and dreams for this year, let me sell you on this idea of doing a fundraiser for yourself or your partner. Aside from the ROI (imagine 30 gifts vs one gift worth hundreds), a fundraiser for Anja earlier this year helped her create her ceramics practice. She wouldn't have been able to do that with dozens of (duplicate) books, candles, kitchen gadgets, plants, and concert tickets. We love our friends and family members, as well as the effort they put into picking the right gift for us. What we love more, though, is that we get to think of them every time we engage with that one huge gift we would've never bought for ourselves.

### So, this year...

1. I'd love to improve my music-making experience with a pair of studio-grade headphones (I had a lovely pair, but the puppy chewed through the cable).
2. In addition, I'd like to record and produce some work with production software.
3. Lastly, after borrowing my neighbor's ukelele for that office party I'm positive: I want one.

If you can, thank you for contributing to my birthday this year. It means a lot to me that we get to celebrate not just my birthday but our relationship as well.

Love ya!
