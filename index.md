# Heya! I am Zinzy Waleson Geene. I come here to learn in public and change my mind. What about you?

This is my personal website, a quiet street on the Internet where I share soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. Whatever brought you here, I hope you have a good time. You can start by learning more [about me](/about), about [my work](/work) or about [this site](/site).
