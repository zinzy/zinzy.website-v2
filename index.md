Heya, I'm Zinzy Waleson Geene, and this is my personal website. I'm a person living and working in Amsterdam. This is a quiet street on the Internet where I share soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear.

### About me
I've been yelling at Internet clouds since 1997. I come from a long line of reluctantly-Catholic, burgundian band geeks. In my Spice Girls-themed bedroom, I taught myself how to build websites. I haven't been the same since. These days, I live in Amsterdam's Indische Buurt, where I share a shoebox and a petit garden with Anja and our puppy Lemonade (who may or may not have her own website, [let's find out together](https://lemonade.waleson.us/)).

### About my work
I have 16 years of working experience as a designer, researcher, and mentor. Currently, I'm UXing at [Leeruniek](https://leeruniek.nl/), where we take a data-driven approach to equitable education. Having sharpened my pencils in both consumer and enterprise spaces, I now specialize in making tools for people at work.
