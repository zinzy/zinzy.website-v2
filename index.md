Heya pal, glad you're here. I'm Zinzy, a human, former band geek, designer and researcher from Amsterdam. This is a quiet street on the Internet where I come to learn in public and change my mind. What about you?

The best way to get to know me is by meeting with me personally. If you're in the neighborhood, feel free to come say [hello](/hello). A good alternative is to look around on this website.
