I"é<p>More than any other time in my online life am I aware of the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text. I make a point to write image descriptions whenever I can. Kind strangers with a variety of accessibility needs have been helping me understand how to best capture my interpretation of an image. Iâ€™ve come to regard <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text as the secret side bar I get to have with blind people and others who need it.</p>

<p>For me, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text raises interesting cultural questions, particularly around its growing visibility. Traditionally, it requires that people who donâ€™t use accessibility tools hover an image to produce what I call â€œthe worldâ€™s slowest tooltipâ€. In addition, Iâ€™ve been seeing a growing number of people work <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text into places where it doesnâ€™t exist. Places that donâ€™t require a hover. Two examples of this are <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@zinzy">Mastodon</a>â€™s profile and banner images.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I saw the profile picture of a young woman winking. Her bio captured the image with something along the lines of â€œyoung woman looking seductively at the camera, winking, and slightly sticking out her tongue hoping to engage the viewerâ€. Before reading that text I felt engaged indeed, my mind painting a quick image of what her manic pixie dream girl university campus life would be like.</p>

<p>Reading her description of the image had an effect. I gather it was the overtness â€” her self-awareness about what the image could convey â€” that somehow put me off just slightly. The image and not so much her description of it but the very fact that I could even see that description, and that she understood I would, changed how I saw her in the image. It also changed how I see the Internet.</p>

<p>What does it mean, Iâ€™ve been thinking ever since, that people with no need for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text get to peek behind its curtain? What effect can this form of double meaning-making have? Does it mean weâ€™ll eventually go on to write things differently, knowing that not a portion of our audience but the entirety of it is looking on? Does it mean we may, some day, try to say less with imagery? In one way, Iâ€™d consider that reduction of fluff a triumph for accessibility.</p>

<p>Today, Piper Haywoodâ€™s blog <a href="https://piperhaywood.com/wais-alt-decision-tree/">put me onto a handy <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text decision tree</a>. Iâ€™m entirely surprised to read that the answer to the final question in the tree, â€œIs the image purely decorative or not intended for the user?â€, is â€œuse an empty <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code>â€ and not â€œdonâ€™t post the imageâ€.</p>

<p>I guess that paints the best picture of how much of a reductionist I am.</p>
