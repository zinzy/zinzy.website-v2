I".<p>Hey <a href="https://www.jboy.space/">John</a> and <a href="https://murb.nl/">Maarten</a>, thanks for meeting me for coffee! I loved nerding out with you two about IndieWeb stuff, personal sites, the red ThinkPad belly button, and what personal web projects we’re working on. As promised, here’s a list of things I wanted to share with you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A few IndieWeb people I like (who are involved in the community in various degrees) are <a href="https://simonesilvestroni.com/">Simone Silverstroni</a>, <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/">Manuel Moreale</a>, <a href="https://muan.co/">Mu-An Chiou</a>, <a href="https://derekkedziora.com/">Derek Kedziora</a>, and <a href="https://elliott.computer/">Elliott Cost</a>, the latter two of whom live in Amsterdam as well.</li>
  <li>The friendly PhD candidate we met is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ornella-porcu-5aa20119">Ornella Porcu</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ll spend some time in the next few weeks cleaning up my site. I’ll probably also try to establish some form of digital garden again.</p>
