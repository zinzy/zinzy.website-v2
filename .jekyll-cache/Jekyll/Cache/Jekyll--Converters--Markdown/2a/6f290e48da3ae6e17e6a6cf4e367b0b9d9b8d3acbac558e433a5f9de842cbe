I"·<p>Sometimes, when bad news arrives, I think to myself â€œargh, just when I was beginning to think life was nice and steady!â€ Today is one of those days. Iâ€™m immediately thrown off, though mostly by the scenarios playing out in my head. Not because of the particular fact of which I learn.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m disappointed by the rediscovery of lifeâ€™s unsteadiness. At the same time, thereâ€™s beauty to be found. After all, there have been times in my life when Iâ€™ve been so anxious that bad news wasnâ€™t an interruption, but a confirmation of what I already thought I knew.</p>

<p>Today, a cloud blocks the sun. I remind myself that itâ€™s a whole lot better than rain all year round.</p>
