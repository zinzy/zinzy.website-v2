I"×<p>Iâ€™m a practitioner of meditation. After sporadically meditating whenever I was feeling any type of overwhelm, Iâ€™ve been applying myself to cultivating a better, healthier, more meaningful practice.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-meditate">Why I meditate</h2>
<p>Now that Iâ€™m beginning to better understand the value of meditation, I use it to improve my concentration, inner sense of calm, but most importantly my ability to identify what Iâ€™m feeling. One of the most difficult things Iâ€™m learning in life is to trust my feelings, and meditation helps me look at them with soft eyes.</p>

<h2 id="what-ive-tried-so-far">What Iâ€™ve tried so far</h2>

<p>Like many others, perhaps youâ€™re one of them, Iâ€™ve tried to meditate using a number of apps:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Headspace:</strong> I love Andyâ€™s calm voice and I appreciate the diversity of guides theyâ€™ve added to the app. Iâ€™ve always been a fan of both the interaction and visual design of the app. A drawback at some point, however, I found the â€œI went to live with the monks so you didnâ€™t have toâ€ atmosphere that Andy sometimes exudes</li>
  <li><strong>Ten Percent Happier:</strong> less friendly in its user experience, I love TPH because of its no-nonsense approach to meditation. I donâ€™t have to hear about somebodyâ€™s trip to Nepal to know they can help me meditate, and thatâ€™s where this app really shines. Itâ€™s so unashamed of its coopting of Eastern culture that it doesnâ€™t even feel it has to connect with it in any way. I find that refreshing.</li>
  <li><strong>Hallow:</strong> while technically a prayer app and not a meditation app, this Catholic prayer platform has various beautiful reflections to listen to. I seem to be engaged in a life-long search for the right fit for religious and areligious spirituality in my life, and for a while I user prayer instead of meditation to find calm.</li>
  <li><strong>Liberate:</strong> my favorite guided</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-ive-learnt">What Iâ€™ve learnt</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Guided meditation in app or podcast form keep me from engaging with actual meditation</li>
  <li>Prayer doesnâ€™t feel as relevant, healing, and healthy to me as meditation</li>
</ul>
