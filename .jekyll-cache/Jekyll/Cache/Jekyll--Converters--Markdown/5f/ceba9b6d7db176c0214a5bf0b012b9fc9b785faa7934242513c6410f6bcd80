I"<p>I reserve a portion of my time to (remotely) mentor researchers and designers. I do this because I find gratification in helping others navigate paths with which I’m familiar. An added bonus is that it helps me keep a pulse on how the tech industry is developing. I’ve been doing this since around 2013.</p>

<p><mark>Good to know: I'm currently on hiatus from mentoring. If you'd like to be reminded when I start back up again, feel free to sign up for my newsletter.</mark></p>

<h3 id="where-i-can-help">Where I can help</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>User advocacy:</strong> I can help you navigate office politics and stakeholder management as you work to be a calm, sincere, not-to-be-messed-with voice for the people who are not in the room.</li>
  <li><strong>Interdisciplinary collaboration:</strong> By letting you focus on individuals over processes, I can help you learn new ways of communicating in a timely and effective way inside and outside of your team.</li>

<h3 id="why-i-mentor">Why I mentor</h3>
<p>These days, you can find me on <a href="https://adplist.org/mentors/zinzy-nev-geene">ADPList</a>, but my efforts originated on my /mentoring page, following <a href="https://dianaberlin.com/">Diana Kimball Berlin</a>, originator of a distributed mentoring movement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every major step forward in my life so far has been inspired and encouraged by the mentors I’ve been fortunate enough to have. I believe that hopes, dreams, and advice are best shared in ongoing, personal relationships, and it’s important to me to make myself available as a mentor to others.”</p>
