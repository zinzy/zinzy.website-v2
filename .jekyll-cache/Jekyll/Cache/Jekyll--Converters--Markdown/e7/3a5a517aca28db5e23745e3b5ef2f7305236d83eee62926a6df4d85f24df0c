I"Ù<p>We had two friends over today. Theyâ€™re dear to me specifically because we got to know each other intimately during our eating disorder recovery. We promised weâ€™d one day get together and watch <em>Love Actually</em>, much-beloved by each of us.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve developed a habit of watching this film at least once a year. Despite its soft romcomness, homogenous cast, and general lack of depth it has taught me volumes on relationships. I love it more with each viewing.</p>

<p>Today, for the first time, perhaps, I saw its fat-phobia for what it really is. It left a sour taste in my mouth; one that reminds me Iâ€™m not the audience of the film, or at least not part of the audience who should feel good after the credits begin to roll.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s annoying to see how a home cinema afternoon can make my body experience drop so significantly. I suppose if thereâ€™s any month in the year to be confronted with this, it would be International Diet Culture Month, ay?</p>
