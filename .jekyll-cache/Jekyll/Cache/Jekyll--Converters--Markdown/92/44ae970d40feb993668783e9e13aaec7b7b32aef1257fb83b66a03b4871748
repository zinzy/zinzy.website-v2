I"¬<p>The world beyond the gender binary is vast and diverse. As a queer facilitator, Iâ€™ve come to appreciate the value of writing my pronouns behind my name when it shows up in a video call or on Slack. It makes it easier for people to be good allies to those of us who have come to use pronouns they werenâ€™t assigned at birth.</p>

<p>As a non-binary person, one of the choices I have had to make was on the topic of pronouns. Surprisingly to some, I use â€œsheâ€, but really Iâ€™ll listen to anything thatâ€™s not â€œitâ€. Multiple people have asked me why this is so. After all, isnâ€™t the whole notion of being non-binary a departure from the â€œsheâ€ that I was assigned at birth?</p>

<p>Yes, but alsoâ€¦</p>

<p>I donâ€™t mind â€œsheâ€. To me, â€œsheâ€ is camp. A Bette Midler song, a Wendy meme. The affection with which Meryl and Goldie address each other in <em>Death Becomes Her</em>. A woman can be a â€œsheâ€, and so can a non-binary or genderqueer person, a man, or a lamp.</p>

<p>Being called â€œsheâ€ doesnâ€™t hurt my reality beyond the binary. On the contrary, it amuses me. Whenever I hear someone refer to me as â€œsheâ€, I giggle a little, as if someone just ran a finger across my spine. Itâ€™s cabaret to me, because that person likely doesnâ€™t use the same defition of â€œsheâ€ as me. This tickling of my sensibilities brings me much more delight than deciding what pronoun works best for me. None of them do.</p>
