I"Ω<p>Dan Russell told Lifehacker almost a decade ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I could reboot my work environment in just an hour or so with a decent internet connection, any laptop, and a stationary store.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I‚Äôm yet to convince myself that is a bad idea. In my journey as a human with a personal computer, I‚Äôve come to prefer platform- and application-agnostic computing over anything else. Sure, I have my preferences, but I don‚Äôt want any long-term engagement with products that force me to limit my opportunities.</p>

<h3 id="tools-dont-matter-means">Tools don‚Äôt matter means:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I focus my attention on an object, not on the tool I can use to manipulate it (example: I keep a large collection of plain text files in )</li>
</ul>

<p>To me, ‚Äútools don‚Äôt matter‚Äù means:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I should focus my attention on the object I would like to manipulate, rather than the tools I can use to do it ()</li>
</ul>
