I"ì<p>I never get much reading done unless Iâ€™m sleeping elsewhere. Most often, I associate sleeping elsewhere with having time off, and having time off means Iâ€™m away from a computer screen. This frees up time for reading.</p>

<p>A had booked a suite for my birthday at Okura, and six months after I turn 33, Covid measures are finally so mild that we actually get to do it. Itâ€™s on the sixteenth floor, overlooking the Amsterdam Centre and West Side. We eat like royalty, and fall asleep watching the sunset from our California King. Iâ€™m feeling like a million bucks.</p>

<p>Whenever we sleep elsewhere, I get overwhelmed with the endless possibilities of the things I can read. Usually, I manage to sneak five books into a suitcase, but for this weekend, Iâ€™ve limited myself to one: _<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/42452986">Mary Magdalene Revealed</a>.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a remarkable read, particularly given that the author Meggan Watterson got an MDiv and not an MFA in writing. Her words flow like a river, entirely sure of where sheâ€™s going. Every now and then, Iâ€™ll read a portion aloud to A, to share the joy of reading a theological work that is as inclusive and self-aware as it is unreserved and educational.</p>

<p>As I share snippets of insights, revelations in sweat lodges as well as things I never knew about the beauty of early Christianity, A asks me: â€œDonâ€™t you find this book a bitâ€¦ <em>The Da Vinci Code</em>-esque? I mean, all this talk of Mary Magdaleneâ€™s special relationship with Jesus, alternative plot linesâ€¦ Itâ€™s like itâ€™s all one big conspiracy theory, wouldnâ€™t you say?â€</p>

<p>Aâ€™s not the only woman who has made such remarks about this book. Isnâ€™t it peculiar that feminists would rather deem femininity-inclusive gospels closer to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1400331">possibly the worst book in the English language that has emerged in the past decade</a> than to a perspective on Christ that could cure our heartaches?</p>
