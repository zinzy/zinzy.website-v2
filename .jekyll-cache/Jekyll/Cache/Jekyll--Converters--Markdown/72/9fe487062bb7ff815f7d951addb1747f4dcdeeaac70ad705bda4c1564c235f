I"ø<p>Inspired by a <a href="https://robhope.com/graveyard">few</a> <a href="https://www.danielzarick.com/failed/">good</a> <a href="">people</a>, I maintain an overview of projects in which Iâ€™ve been involved. I love personal websites that arenâ€™t just a highlight reel of someoneâ€™s life, but that instead give a glimpse into someoneâ€™s actual life. The projects below were all part of my life at one point or another. If youâ€™d like to learn more about them, <a href="/hello">get in touch</a>.</p>
