I"¦<p>At the end of the shopping street<br />
for people who look like<br />
they do in the magazines<br />
thereâ€™s a blonde marching in place waiting<br />
for the light to turn green.<br />
She is not running per se, rather<br />
sheâ€™s hinting at running.<br />
Selling it, the way<br />
Charlize Theron sells<br />
a night to remember in a perfume commercial<br />
with next to nothing for evidence.</p>

<p>Me, a tired mother,<br />
and a tennis player with wet hair<br />
stare at the blonde,<br />
one more covertly than<br />
the others.<br />
I know not to tilt my head<br />
when encounting something<br />
in which the world tells me<br />
I will never see myself.</p>

<p>There are so many things<br />
that are perfect<br />
about the blonde that I<br />
get dizzy counting.<br />
Even a thigh gap as big as hers<br />
wouldnâ€™t be able to hold<br />
all the details.</p>

<p>At this point, the length,<br />
and the waviness, and the glossiness,<br />
and the readiness of her hair<br />
are just a complete unnecessity.</p>

<p>We all hate her, the blonde.<br />
Me, a tired mother,<br />
and a tennis player with wet hair.<br />
We hate her because<br />
of all the little things<br />
the world has denied us<br />
the words to articulate.</p>

<p>We all hate her, the blonde,<br />
and the blonde hates herself<br />
a little, too,<br />
for reasons so bafflingly<br />
unimportant to us<br />
she could die from jealousy.</p>
