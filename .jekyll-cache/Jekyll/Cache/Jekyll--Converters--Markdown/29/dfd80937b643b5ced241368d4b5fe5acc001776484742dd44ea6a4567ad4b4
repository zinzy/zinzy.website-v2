I"ù<p>This here is a quiet street of the Internet where I come to link and think. Youâ€™ll find soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear. The space is organized as a â€œdigital gardenâ€, a casual collection of unfinished thoughts, not a portfolio of any kind.</p>
