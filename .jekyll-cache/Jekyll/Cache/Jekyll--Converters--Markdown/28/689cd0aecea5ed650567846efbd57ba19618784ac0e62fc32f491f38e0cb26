I"π<p>Welcome to my home on the Internet. This website was <a class="internal-link" href="/colophon">hand-built</a> by me, and I‚Äôm the only one publishing things on it. It contains facts about me, what I love, and the work I do, but also working notes on a wide variety of subjects. This is an example of a personal website.</p>

<h3 id="you-should-make-a-personal-website">You should make a personal website</h3>
<p>You are a citizen of the Internet.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> It might be difficult to remember, but the World Wide Web was built for <em>you</em>. Built for your adventures, information, freedom, education, entertainment. You‚Äôre allowed to enjoy yourself here, to share what you‚Äôre experiencing, and to learn something new.</p>

<h4 id="say-what-you-want">Say what you want</h4>
<p>Your personal website is your corner of the web. Do with it what you want<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Use it to tell your full story: what are you learning about life? How did that new recipe turn out? What are you reading? You are you celebrating, grieving? What are you struggling with? What are you hoping for? Take up space, and tell the Internet all about it. Give us a window into your tiny beautiful life.</p>

<h4 id="enjoy-your-autonomy">Enjoy your autonomy</h4>
<p>It‚Äôs great that your friends are all on the social platforms, but why let Zuckerberg decide how you express yourself? Imagine the image-free Instagram post, the 4000-character tweet, the timeline of your favorite songs of the year, accompanied by an essay on why they matter to you. On your website, <em>you</em> decide what you put out there. And you can keep it there forever, not until your favorite social app is absorbed by a tech giant.</p>

<h4 id="be-discoverable">Be discoverable</h4>
<p>When I want to know how someone‚Äôs doing, I google them. I love it when I discover a distant friend has a personal website, or when I learn that a mate from uni runs a little blog. I don‚Äôt care about their personal brand, or how professional they come across to me. I just want to learn about their lives. Be that person.</p>

<h4 id="showcase-your-creativity">Showcase your creativity</h4>
<p>If you‚Äôre reading this, chances are you can‚Äôt imagine how I created this website. Neither did I, at one point in the distant past. But it‚Äôs fun to learn! These days, setting up your website is super easy, and there are countless possibilities. You can make a full-blown blog with <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a>, a simple and gorgeous site with <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a>, or a Dropbox-based blog with <a href="https://blot.im/">Blot.im</a>. The more you know, the more you can do on the web!</p>
