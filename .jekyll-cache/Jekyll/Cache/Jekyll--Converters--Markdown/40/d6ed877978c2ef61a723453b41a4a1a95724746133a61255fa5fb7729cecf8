<p>The Dutch education system ranks number one in Europe when it comes to early segregation of pupils into levels: the split happens at age 12.</p>

<p>One frequently overheard platitude that I hear education professionals say a lot is that teachers are responsible for helping children move as high up the ladder as they can. After all, higher up means more opportunities.</p>

<p>What these people may forget is that a larger amount of career opportunities does not equal better opportunities, particularly if a pupil’s way of learning does not benefit from a certain level. This perspective also ignores that pupil-focused ascension on the ladder only increases the existing disparaties in the educational quality of certain levels</p>
