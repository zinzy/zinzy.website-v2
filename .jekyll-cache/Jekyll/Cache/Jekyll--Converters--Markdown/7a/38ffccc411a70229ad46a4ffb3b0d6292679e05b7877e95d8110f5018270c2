I"æ<p><a class="internal-link" href="/about">My</a> second brain is a large collection of plain text files that I maintain as a repository for things I would like to retrieve later but donâ€™t want to remember now. The public part of it can be found in my <a href="/digital-garden">digital garden</a>.</p>

<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>
<p>One of my tenets is that &lt;a class=â€™internal-linkâ€™ href=â€™/Tools%20donâ€™t%20matter/â€™&gt;tools donâ€™t matter&lt;/a&gt;. The only thing that matters about a tool is that it must allow me to manipulate plain text or Markdown files that exist in a folder that I can move around freely. I once learned that</p>

<p>I donâ€™t enjoy having to export things out of my system every time I change tools.</p>
