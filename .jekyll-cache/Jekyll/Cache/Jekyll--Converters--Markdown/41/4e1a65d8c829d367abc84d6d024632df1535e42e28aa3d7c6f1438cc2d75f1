I"–<p>In January of 2021 I created a one-pager called â€œIs the Pope gay?â€. As is the case with so many of my other ideas, I came up with this website because something happened on the <a class="internal-link" href="/internet">Internet</a>: the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gay</code> domain extension had just become available. Next to isthepope.gay, I registered a wide variety of domains. My favorite was everyoneatthevaticanis.gay, which led to my own website.</p>

<p>After a year of cheap fun Iâ€™ve let go of all of my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gay</code> domains, but this project remains on <a href="https://isthepopegay.netlify.app/">Netlify</a>.</p>
