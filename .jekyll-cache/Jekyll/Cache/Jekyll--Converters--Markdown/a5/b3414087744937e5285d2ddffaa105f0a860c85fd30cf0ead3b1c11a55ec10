I"a<p>Since July of 2023, if you’re hoping to interact with me on a topic that might be particularly difficult for me, I may send out a payment request for an emotional labor fee.</p>

<p>Let me elaborate.</p>

<p>A standard-issue part of my life is being approached by people who want to talk to me about today’s hot button issues: racism, pronouns, and gender diversity. I call the part of life “standard-issue” because the way people start them, talk during them, and end them are the same.</p>

<p>A conversation may start like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“I have a question and you might actually <em>really</em> be able to help me out with this: what do you think of the fact that my timeline is full of X?”</li>
  <li>“I really love that people are standing up against X but you can’t see anything anymore these days….”</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note the pattern here:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each of these examples is an invitation to connect and share</li>
  <li>They both start with something position, either about me or about the general state of things</li>
  <li>Each leave a silence for me to justify X</li>
  <li>X could be any topic the designated community of which I can represent: racism, sexual and gender diversity, pronoun use</li>
</ul>

<p>Conversations like this might also include <span title="This note is not for public consumption (yet)" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Cat whisper  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span>s,</p>

<p>I’ve been carrying around a trump card that is helping me overcome complex trauma that had been with me the majority of my life.</p>

<p>Lately, I’ve been experimenting with what started out as a hilarious joke and is gradually becoming a healing tool in my experience with complex trauma.</p>

<p>The emotional labor fee is a payment request sent out via phone (Venmo for American readers, Tikkie for Dutch readers, to all the other readers: I have no idea what you use and I apologize). It helps me what has always seemed impossible when people would broach the subject of discrimination: pause and think “do I want this?”</p>
