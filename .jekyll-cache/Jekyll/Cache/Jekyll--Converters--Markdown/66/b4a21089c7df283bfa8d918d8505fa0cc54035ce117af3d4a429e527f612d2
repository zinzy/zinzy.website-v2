I"Œ<p>Iâ€™m having trouble getting enough rest this week.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Saw Hannah Gadsbyâ€™s <a class="internal-link" href="/body-of-work">Body of Work</a></li>
  <li>Watched as Mastodon saw a torrent of â€œTwitter refugeesâ€ join the club.</li>
  <li>Thought about what Jon Bell said, and how important <a class="internal-link" href="/people-not-users">People not users</a> is to me</li>
</ul>
