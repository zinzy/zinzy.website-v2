I"÷<p>Hello, Iâ€™m <a class="internal-link" href="/about">Zinzy Waleson</a>!</p>

<p>I love the intersection of design, research, and strategy, and I also love cooking, making music, yoga, reading, and cinema.</p>

<p>I enjoy meeting new people. If you have something to share, youâ€™d like to play or learn together, or can think of any othe reason we should be talking, get in touch with me. This is my <a href="https://alastairjohnston.com/introducing-hello-pages/">hello</a> page, where you can learn how I like to keep in touch.</p>

<p>How to contact me:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For any inquiry, email is your best shot. Please use my <a class="internal-link" href="/contact">contact form</a>.</li>
  <li>I infrequently check <a href="https://mstdn.social/@zinzy">Mastodon</a> because I like things that are decentralized.</li>
  <li>If youâ€™d like to schedule mentor time with me, check my <a class="internal-link" href="/mentoring">mentoring</a> page (Iâ€™m currently on hiatus from it)</li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not use social media. Any account in my name that you may find is not in use, so feel safe to assume I wonâ€™t see your message</p>
  </li>
  <li>I donâ€™t use any other social media beyond the above, except inÂ <em><strong>extremely</strong></em>Â rare cases when Iâ€™m otherwise unable to find a way to communicate with someone Iâ€™m needing to contact. If you find any account in my name on a social media platform, you can assume I wonâ€™t ever see messages sent to it, and I wonâ€™t be notified of mentions/interactions with it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of your answers might be found on my <a class="internal-link" href="/faq">faq</a> page.</p>
