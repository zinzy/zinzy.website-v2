I"Ô<p>Inspired by both <a href="https://busterbenson.com/codex">Buster Bensonâ€™s <em>Codex</em></a> and <a href="https://elliott.computer/pages/opinion/">Elliott Costâ€™s <em>Opinions</em></a> Iâ€™m using this page to grow a record of things I believe.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>If youâ€™re Zinzy:</strong> use this page as a reference point, to remind yourself of what life really is about to you. These things may be subject to change.</li>
  <li><strong>If youâ€™re someone else:</strong> feel free to read and learn, and remember that youâ€™re not Zinzy, and you may disagree with her. Thatâ€™s okay. Take this permission slip to make your own codex! These things may be subject to change.</li>
