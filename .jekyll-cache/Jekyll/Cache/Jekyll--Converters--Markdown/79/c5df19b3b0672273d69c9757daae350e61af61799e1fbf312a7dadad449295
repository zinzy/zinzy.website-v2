I"Ì<p>Sometimes, when bad news arrives, I think to myself â€œargh, just when I was beginning to think things were nice and steady!â€ Today is one of those days. Iâ€™m immediately thrown off, thought mostly at the thought of the scenarios playing out in my head. Not because of the particular fact of which I learned.</p>

<p>It makes me disappointed in life. At the same time, thereâ€™s beauty in thinking what I did earlier today. After all, there have been times in my life when Iâ€™ve been so anxious that bad news wasnâ€™t an interruption, but a confirmation of what I felt to be true.</p>

<p>Today, Iâ€™m seeing a cloud block the sun. I remind myself that itâ€™s a whole lot better than rain all year round.</p>
