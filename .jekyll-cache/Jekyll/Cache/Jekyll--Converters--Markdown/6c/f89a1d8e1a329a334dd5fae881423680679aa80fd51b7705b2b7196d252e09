I"£<p>Writing case studies is one of the best ways for me to zoom out and look at what Iâ€™ve accomplished in my professional life. Here are some best practices Iâ€™ve been using.</p>

<h3 id="write-case-studies-when-you-dont-need-them">Write case studies when you donâ€™t need them</h3>
<p>I am well familiar with the dread of having to put together a design portfolio. Itâ€™s exciting once itâ€™s live, but up until that point, it feels as though Iâ€™m a house painter, and my prospective clients come to my house to assess how well Iâ€™ve done. I do my best to write case studies periodically, picking interesting features or processes in which Iâ€™ve been involved recently.</p>

<p>Rather than working to fill sections with technical and practical information (â€œthis was my role in the teamâ€, â€œI used these methodsâ€), I do my best to embed this content in a broader story. I donâ€™t typically use the headings listed below, but these are the elements that make up any case study I write:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Background:</strong> things were giong great until we realized there was a problem for our customers</li>
  <li><strong>Conflict</strong>: this is the first time Iâ€™ve ever done something like this, I wasnâ€™t sure if Iâ€™d be able to do everything</li>
  <li><strong>Rising action</strong>: I tried many things, failed a bunch. I learned how important it is to continually iterate, get stakeholder feedback, and involve engineering early in the process</li>
  <li><strong>Climax</strong>: I wasnâ€™t sure if weâ€™d make it, but we did and it was a success</li>
  <li><strong>Failing action</strong>: by involving engineering early, we side-stepped a massive problem and forged new bonds for future projects</li>
  <li><strong>Resolution</strong>: the solution we built has been receiving mostly positive feedback from customers. Weâ€™ll be iterating soonâ€¦</li>
</ul>
