    <p>Thinking about visual literacy, in part because the bulk of <a href="https://anjawaleson.notion.site/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55">Anja</a>â€™s academic work is focused on it right now, but also because I just love telling people off whenever they say that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/07/a-novel-idea-is-the-book-always-better-than-the-film">â€œthe book is better than the movieâ€</a>.</p>

    <p>Iâ€™m interested in learning about buddhism, but I donâ€™t know where to start. Everything seems either too technical or too Pinterst quotesque. A trusted source tells me Pema ChÃ¶drÃ¶n, Thich Nhat Hanh, and Herman Hesseâ€™s <em>Siddharta</em> are good entry point. Off we go.</p>

    <p>Iâ€™ve been [[mentoring]] over on <a href="https://adplist.org/mentors/zinzy-nev-geene">ADPList</a> for a while now, and I can only say Iâ€™m truly enjoying it. Itâ€™s great to work with researchers, designers, and product managers in different stages of their careers.</p>

          <td>After months of being, in essense, a recruitment manager, we added two new amazing talents to our team. I have one more role to fill, but Iâ€™m very pleased that the bulk of my time at work now goes to research, strategy, mentoring, and operations. Feels good to be back. In all of it, Iâ€™m working to rely on my intuition, and to ask [[seven questions</td>

    <p>Iâ€™ve been experimenting with new dishes:</p>

    <p>Weâ€™ve been into [[The Staircase]]. I remember watching it years ago, and now that the rather satisfying HBO series is available, weâ€™re rewatching the documentary for extra context. Itâ€™s striking to see what role anti-queer rhetoric played in the investigation and media coverage.</p>

    <p>Things look a little bit different on this site, and thatâ€™s mainly because I built it again, this time using Maxime Vaillancourtâ€™s <a href="https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template">digital garden Jekyll template</a>.</p>
