<p>In the name of destigmatization of health issues I decided a while ago that I was going to use this website to write about what it means to have an eating disorder. This page chronicles some of the experiences I have as I go through recovery.</p>

<h3 id="meet-my-eating-disorder">Meet my eating disorder</h3>
<p>My eating disorder has developed in response to a number of (untreated) adverse childhood experiences, which left me feeling powerless, unsafe, and unimportant. The first eating disordered act I remember was at age seven, but really there is no time â€œbefore my eating disorderâ€. The first time I knew I had an eating disorder was in my early teens.</p>

<p>Or rather than â€œknewâ€ I â€œwantedâ€ one.</p>

<p>With the rise of Web 2.0, I fell into a deep hole of pro-ana Xanga blogs that showed me that having an eating disorder was glamorous, effective, and hip. A close friend and I would get together and â€œfakeâ€ having an eating disorder by carrying out associated behaviors. Things I now know to be life-threatening, and detrimental to anyoneâ€™s long-term mental health. At home, certainly dictated by <a class="internal-link" href="/diet-culture">Diet culture</a>, my Food Rule Book began growing and growing.</p>

<p>Despite the signs, my eating disorder remained untreated.</p>

<p>Somehow, in my late teens, I managed to pivot. I began telling myself that what I had been doing was terrible, that I deserved a better life. I moved away for university, and began taking care of my own mini household, which, with all the laundry, and the studying, and the cleaning, and the cooking, I found rather overwhelming. My Food Rule Book became a safe haven, just now with new rules. The rules were as volatile as the oneâ€™s Iâ€™d created before, just different.</p>

<p>For well over a decade I considered myself recovered from my teenage eating disorder. After all, I wasnâ€™t really doing what I had done as a teenager.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I knew I would always have â€œfood troubleâ€, as Iâ€™d tell myself.</p>

<p>Then Covid came. At the cusp of the first round of vaccines, I received an invitation to discuss my options with our family doctor. I was eager to get the shot, but not if it was Astra Zeneca, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca#Side-effects_2">which was soon to be taken out of rotation due to health risks</a>. My doctor gave me some time to think it over, and when I did, I had a thought that would save my life: â€œwhy am I so scared of a vaccine when I am willingly destroying my body in the name of â€˜food troubleâ€™?â€</p>

<p>My doctor referred me to a clinic for eating disorders, and Iâ€™ve been coming to terms with</p>
