I"É<p>Have you heard? Anja and I are getting a dog. It was up in the air for a little while, but we got the confirmation yesterday that weâ€™ll get first pick of a nest of eight adorable little Pembroke - Cardigan corgi mixes. Weâ€™re meeting the puppies for the first time on Sunday. Are you crying? Iâ€™m crying.</p>

<p><a href="/2022/12/30/2022-in-review/">2022 showed me</a> that there are serious drawbacks to being an A type personality. The way it helps Anja and I prepare for a puppy isnâ€™t one of them. Too excited to sleep, I now <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@zinzy/109674435586703598">wake at 04:15</a> to formulate schedules, training OKRs, and crate strategies.</p>

<p>Annoyingly, Iâ€™ve now become one of those people who thinks they know a minuscule sliver of the dread expecting parents must feel, aiming to read all of the worldâ€™s parenting books before retiring on the idea that, at the end of the day, itâ€™s all about intuition and consistency.</p>
