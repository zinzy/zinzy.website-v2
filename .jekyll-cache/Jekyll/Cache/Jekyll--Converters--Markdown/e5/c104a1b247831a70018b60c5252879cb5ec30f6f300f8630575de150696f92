I"Ë<p>Dan Russell told Lifehacker almost a decade ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I could reboot my work environment in just an hour or so with a decent internet connection, any laptop, and a stationary store.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Iâ€™m yet to convince myself that is a bad idea. In my journey as a human with a personal computer, Iâ€™ve come to prefer platform- and application-agnostic computing over anything else. Sure, I have my preferences, but I donâ€™t want any long-term engagement with products that force me to limit my opportunities.</p>

<h3 id="tools-dont-matter-means">Tools donâ€™t matter means:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I focus my attention on an object, not on the tool I can use to manipulate it (example: I keep a large collection of plain text files in my <a class="internal-link" href="/second-brain">second brain</a>. Over the years, Iâ€™ve used countless apps to manipulate these files.)</li>
  <li>With analog writing, rather than fixing myself to a particular method of archiving, or a set of writing tools (which is what a part of me desperately needs) I mix up where and how I write.</li>
  <li>I donâ€™t use desktop or smartphone apps that require me to export my data  and back it up independently ()</li>
</ul>
