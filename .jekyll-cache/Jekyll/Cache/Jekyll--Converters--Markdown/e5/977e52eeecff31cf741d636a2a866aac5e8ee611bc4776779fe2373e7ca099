I"b<p>A year ago, as part of my eating disorder recovery journey, my therapist asked me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What are your core values? Like, what are your deepest needs and desires?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She reminded me last week that, instead of pausing to think of a response, I laughed straight in her face.</p>

<p>Historically, I’ve had trouble identifying what I want, need, desire, hope for, and dream of.</p>

<p>In-patient treatment has helped train that muscle, though. My first vision board there consisted of kind interactions with strangers in coffee houses, while other clients were planning to pursue a Master’s or travel the world. On the flight back I made my first-ever attempt at a bucket list.</p>

<p>Treatment taught me a hack that’s now helping me figure out what I hope 2023 will look like. Instead of identifying what I <em>do</em> hope, want, and yearn for, I look at what I <em>don’t</em>. What I hate can tell me something about what I fear. What I fear can, in turn, lead me to what I desire. Knowing what I suck at can help me identify challenges I might encounter as I move towards those desires.</p>

<p>As the year comes to a close, and as I figure out once again, but now from scratch, I’m asking myself:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What do I hate?</li>
  <li>What do I fear?</li>
  <li>What do I suck at?</li>
</ul>

<p>Rather than seeing my weak points as things I must improve in order to be healthy and happy, I try to figure out how I can use these characteristics to my benefit. I’m looking forward to optimizing <em>for</em> them, so I can have a realistic outlook as I learn and thrive.</p>
