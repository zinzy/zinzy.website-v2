I"v<p>Hey <a href="https://elliott.computer/">Elliott</a>, so lovely to have you over for coworking this afternoon! I love the way you think about UX; your artistic perspective is so valuable for the Internet and for web design, and you always make me see things from a new angle. Aside from the links I already shared with John and Maarten on <a href="/2023-06-23-14-00-00">June 23rd</a>, here’s some stuff I love:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://jason.cosper.me/">Jason Cosper</a> inspired me to get rid of my About page.</li>
  <li><a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile</a> and <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum">Scrum</a> are quite complex, and multi-interpretable, but <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/lean-ux-agile-study-guide/">Nielsen Norman Group</a> has a few nice resources.</li>
  <li>When it comes to extraversion and “people-person”-ness, I think the UX industry is quite a good fit for those who aren’t those things. Like I said, your ability to create an icebreaker on the fly isn’t half as interesting as your ability to figure out what UX method can answer a specific question. This reminds me of <a href="https://vimeo.com/719000396/65193d4f26">a talk I attended at UXInsights Festival 2022</a>, which wasn’t about this topic per se, but about making UX research accessible for neurodivergent UX professionals. You might like it!</li>
</ul>
