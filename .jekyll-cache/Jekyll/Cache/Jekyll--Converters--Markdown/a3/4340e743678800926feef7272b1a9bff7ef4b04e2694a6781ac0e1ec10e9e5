<p>When I first set foot in the <a href="https://amsterdam.oudkatholiek.nl/">Old Catholic Church</a> to attend an All Saints service, <a href="/2023/02/12/all-saints-amsterdam/">I knew I had found a special place</a>. Today is the third time I make it to their service, which is always on the second Sunday of the month.</p>

<p>It just so happens that this second Sunday falls on Easter, and itâ€™s perhaps because of this that the service is more crowded than previous times. I see All Saints regulars as well as new people, shy and seemingly hopeful.</p>

<p>One woman in particular stands out to me because she smiles intently at me a few times. She has the demeanor of that good Christian girl from that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DunderMifflin/comments/hqskev/scotts_tots_may_be_super_cringe_but_its_nearly/"><em>Office US</em> episode â€œChristeningâ€</a>.</p>

<p>After service she finds me immediately: â€œYouâ€™re Zinzy from <a href="https://meetup.com/queersalon">Queer Salon</a>, right?â€ Annika says. Pre-pandemic memories begin to surface, and once she mentions her son I remember her again. â€œThe first time I came here, I thought of youâ€, she says. We shmooze over crackers and sweet bread, exchange numbers to set a coffee date.</p>

<p>This new church is really a pilot by two reverends hoping to bring fully inclusive Christianity to the Amsterdam expat community. This is service eight out of ten. When I say that out loud, Reverend Howie casually says â€œyes, weâ€™ll have to talk about that next time.â€</p>

<p>I already canâ€™t imagine myself without this community.</p>
