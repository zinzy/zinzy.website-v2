I"¿<p>As an advocate of plain-text densely-linked notes, I have the difficult task of deciding what taxonomy and hierarchy will underpin my notes collection. Within my tool of choice, <span title="This note is not for public consumption (yet)" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Obsidian  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span>, I have the option to use actual <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#tag</code>s, as well as linked notes that can serve as organizers.</p>

<p>Currently, I use the following principles in structuring my work:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To best learn about the hidden connections in my writing, I let the text speak for itself as much ad possible. This means that, if I can, I donâ€™t use a traditional tag such as  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#psychology</code>.</li>
  <li>Instead, Iâ€™ll create a link to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;span title='This note is not for public consumption (yet)' class='invalid-link'&gt;  &lt;span class='invalid-link-brackets'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Psychology  &lt;span class='invalid-link-brackets'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code>, which or may not already be a page. Using the <span title="This note is not for public consumption (yet)" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Obsidian Graph  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span> functionality, structure  will naturally emerge, and I can identify themes that I apparently mention frequently but which donâ€™t have a page yet.</li>
  <li>The primary way in which I use tags is to identify particular kinds of notes; ones I need to visualize productivity or information in a particular way. I use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#project/active</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#project/inactive</code> to organize my commitments. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#person</code> tag helps me collect <a class="internal-link" href="/notes-on-people">Notes on people</a>, their contact and birthday informations, etc.</li>
  <li>Another purpose for tags in my notes collection is to assign attributes to my day, which I use as part of mt <span title="This note is not for public consumption (yet)" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Self-tracking  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span>. I use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#feel/happy</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#feel/anxious</code> in my daily logging, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#sleep/good</code> and  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#dream/weird</code> to classify my nocturnal adventures.</li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™ve always struggled to define a solid course of action for my tagging hygiene. <a href="https://forum.obsidian.md/t/how-to-use-tags/35320/14">This comment on the Obsidian forum</a> helped me see that I really only use functional tags. My bottom-up approach for letting topics emerge through dense linking is entirely inspired by <a href="https://youtu.be/E6ySG7xYgjY">Artem Kirsanovâ€™s video detailing his Obsidian setup</a>.</p>
