I"¯<p>Every year, without fail, I find myself longing for Autumn in the middle of Summer. Iâ€™m looking forward to cups of tea, blankets, and rainy afternoons. Much like the characters in <em>Youâ€™ve Got Mail</em>, I love September because it reminds me of freshly-sharpened pencils and other things that prompt a back-to-school vibe. Iâ€™m also looking forward to quilting a prayer mat.</p>

<p>What Iâ€™m enjoying spiritual reflections on the Lectio 365 app, as well as CelinaSpookyBooâ€™s dad jokes and her accompanying laugh. Iâ€™ve been reading about chronic shame. Iâ€™ve been playing around with Gatsby starters for a bit, and Iâ€™m ready to begin building things from scratch.</p>
