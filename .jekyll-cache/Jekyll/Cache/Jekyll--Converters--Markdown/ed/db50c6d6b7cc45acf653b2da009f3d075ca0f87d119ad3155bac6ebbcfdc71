I"±<p>Proudly nasty, I joined Anja, my mother-in-law Sauci, and millions of others around the world last Saturday to attend the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Women%27s_March">Womenâ€™s March</a>. Museum Square in Amsterdam was full of pussy hats, face paint, smiling faces, and righteous indignation.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t often attend protests, not in the last place because Iâ€™m cautious about negative media outlets that often ridicule protesters, but I loved being a part of this day. I have no idea whatâ€™s in store with this American presidency, but I imagine it canâ€™t be very positive. I feel fortunate to live in a place that lends itself well to such protests. It makes me feel less scared and less alone.</p>

<p>What a time to be alive.</p>
