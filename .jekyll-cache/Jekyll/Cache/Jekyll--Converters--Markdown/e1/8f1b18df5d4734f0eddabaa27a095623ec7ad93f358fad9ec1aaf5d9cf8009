I"Ô<p>I am on a 33-day streak picking my teeth before bed. Iâ€™ve designed a temptation bundle, pairing the activity with a few minutes of garbage television. During these days, Iâ€™ve made it through two seasons of <em>Love After Lockup</em> and six seasons of <em>Sister Wives</em>. It shouldnâ€™t surprise you that my watching habit has extended well beyond the time it takes me to pick my teeth. Earlier this week I decided to tone it down and return the temptation bundle to its original intention. Not because I want to watch less garbage television, but because I donâ€™t want <em>Sister Wives</em> to end.</p>

<p>I watched the trailer for <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WL3Jz8fDgFI">Them</a></em> and it didnâ€™t take long for me to decide I wasnâ€™t going to watch the series, despite how much I love Lena Waithe. People who are close to me know this already, but the classroom scene could have been taken from my life. I think Iâ€™m ready for <a href="https://audacity.substack.com/p/reality-is-horror-enough">Black narratives that donâ€™t <em>just</em> center around the entertainment of collective and private trauma of Black people</a>.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re in the process of perfecting our tossed pasta recipe.</p>
