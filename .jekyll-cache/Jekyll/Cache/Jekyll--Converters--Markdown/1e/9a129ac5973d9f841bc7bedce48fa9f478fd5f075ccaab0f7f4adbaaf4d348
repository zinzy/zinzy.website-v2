I"@<p>In personal knowledge management, contact information might not be the first thing I think to document. After all, between my phone, Google, and the Mac OS X Contacts app, I figure I’ll always be able to find what I need.</p>

<p>Until I don’t.</p>

<p>Following my personal principle that <a class="internal-link" href="/information-should-be-made-to-last">Information should be made to last</a>, I have been using <span title="This note is not for public consumption (yet)" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Obsidian  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span> to collect information on the people in my life. The system contains standard information such as address details, but also their birthday, gifts that we’ve exchanged, and other details that I may find important.</p>
