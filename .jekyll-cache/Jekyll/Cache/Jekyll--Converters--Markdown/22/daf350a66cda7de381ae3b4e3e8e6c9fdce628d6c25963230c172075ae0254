I";<p>I reserve a portion of my time to (remotely) mentor researchers and designers. I do this because I find gratification in helping others navigate paths with which I’m familiar. An added bonus is that it helps me keep a pulse on how the tech industry is developing. I’ve been doing this since around 2013.</p>
