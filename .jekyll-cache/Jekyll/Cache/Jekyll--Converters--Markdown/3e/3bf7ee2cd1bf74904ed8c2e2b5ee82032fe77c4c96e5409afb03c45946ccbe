I"™<h3 id="im-thinking-of-moving-into-ux-can-we-chat">Iâ€™m thinking of moving into UX. Can we chat?</h3>
<p>Iâ€™m currently taking a break from extracurricular activities, and so I donâ€™t have space on my calendar for mentoring. Feel free, however, to connect with me on <a href="https://nl.linkedin.com/in/zinzy">LinkedIn</a>. Who knows what the future might have in store for us.</p>

<h3 id="can-you-help-me-with-my-personal-brand--logo--website">Can you help me with my personal brand / logo / website?</h3>
<p>No. While I enjoyed running my own design studio for eight years, my design efforts these days are geared towards tools that people use at work. I can tell you this, though: <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a> and <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/categories/graphics-design">Fiverr</a> give most people what they need, and if your company name is your name, you donâ€™t need a logo.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-interview-you-for-my-podcast">Can I interview you for my podcast?</h3>
<p>Maybe! I enjoy speaking about my work in design and product, as well as intersectionality, anti-racism, queer Christianity, and what it means to be a queer Afropean Catholic. <a href="/contact">Send me an email</a> and Iâ€™ll let you know if I have time.</p>

<h3 id="can-you-write-something-for-me">Can you write something for me?</h3>
<p>Who knows! <a href="/contact">Email</a> me about your request and letâ€™s chat.</p>
