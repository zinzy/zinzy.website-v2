I"Ž<p>Iâ€™m Zinzy Waleson, a person on the Internet. I taught myself how to build websites when I was eleven, and Iâ€™ve been using this skill to navigate the Internet ever since. Iâ€™m a diarist, a home cook, music maker, and cinephile. Iâ€™m also a designer, researcher, and product person working on education technology. I live and work in Amsterdam, where I share a shoe box with my partner.</p>
