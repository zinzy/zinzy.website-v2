<p>Heya pal, I’m pleased you made it to my personal website. It’s a quiet street on the Internet where I come to learn in public, change my mind, and document and nurture my interests. The best way to get to know me is by spending time with me. Reading the things on this website is a soft alternative.</p>

<h3 id="in-life">In life</h3>
<p>I’m a queer Afropean person who is a nerd for the independent internet (which is where humans aren’t products). I’m a musician, a cinephile, a writer, and an urbanite. In the Eastside of Amsterdam, my partner Anja and I share a wonderful shoebox.</p>

<h3 id="at-work">At work</h3>
<p>I’m a generalist with thorough experience solving problems where research, design, systems, and strategy meet. Right now I work as a UX Manager in educational technology at Leeruniek. I have sixteen years of professional experience making digital products. Before this, I lead design at Airtrade for five years. Before that, I ran Studio Zinzy for eight years.</p>
