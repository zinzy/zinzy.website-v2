I"£<p>At the time of writing, January 11, 2023, this page is unlisted on my website. I suspect this project will turn out to be nothing at all, but wouldnâ€™t it be so fun if I could do this successfully?</p>

<p>The first time the number 1095 began to carry any significance to me was <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061215051700/http://1095.naughtyjames.com/">The 1095 Project</a>, a photo blog project by London-based photographer Craig Cowling (known then as Naughty James), which ran from December 15 2003 - 2006. A photograph, often without words, every day for three years straight. 20 years later, Iâ€™m still not over it.</p>

  <li>Show up: show up and publish</li>
  <li>Donâ€™t bother drafting: drafts make the idea of writing online bigger than it needs to be. Write about now: whatâ€™s happening today? What are you feeling here? What were you thinking earlier?</li>
