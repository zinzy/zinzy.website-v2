I"<p>Her Summer break started yesterday, and as always it is an event. I am so excited about getting everything right that I mostly present as a frantic killjoy. <em>Jeopardy</em> makes everything better.</p>

<p>I start today with my usual bike route past the bakeries. Niemeijer for pain au choc and canelÃ©s, followed by tiger buns and krentenbollen at <a href="https://simonmeijssen.nl/">Simon Meijssen</a>. Niemeijer won best croissant of Amsterdam, but I think theyâ€™re too bready.</p>

<p>In the window of Meijssen theyâ€™re showcasing pride muffins. Neither of us likes muffins, but I buy two anyway. Theyâ€™re surprisingly good.</p>
