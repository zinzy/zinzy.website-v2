<p>Spring is here, I think? I spend the afternoon in the park with ex-colleague-turned-friend Susan, who is celebrating landing a new and challenging job. Thereâ€™s a boy in the park whoâ€™s walking around barefoot. Later we see him on a slack line. I like this scene; it tells me that summer is almost upon us.</p>

<p>I never seem skilled at enjoying whatever season is here. Instead Iâ€™m forever yearning for whatâ€™s just out of reach. On Javastraat I pass a travel agency, the target audience of which most certainly is concerned with visiting Morocco or Turkey during the summer months. Surprisingly, thereâ€™s a wide array of names that would inspire city trips around the world.</p>

<p>Ever since I passed the agency, Andrew Birdâ€™s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oecHq2neweA">Pulaski at Night</a> has been in my head non-stop. â€œCome back to Chigaco, city of, city of light.â€</p>
