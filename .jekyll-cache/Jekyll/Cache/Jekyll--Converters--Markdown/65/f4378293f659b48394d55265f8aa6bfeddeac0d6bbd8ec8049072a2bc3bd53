<h3 id="im-zinzy-waleson-geene-im-in-my-mid-thirties-and-i-have-a-penchant-for-casual-web-publishing">Iâ€™m Zinzy Waleson Geene, Iâ€™m in my mid-thirties and I have a penchant for casual web publishing</h3>
<p>This website is a digital living room; a place where I think aloud, change my mind, and share slices of life. I think the Internet is a miraculous place, and believe we all have the right to own our stuff, and do so in a sustainable way. I suppose this means I like <a href="https://indieweb.org/principles">IndieWeb principles</a>.</p>

<h3 id="i-live-in-amsterdams-finest-neighborhood-de-indische-buurt">I live in Amsterdamâ€™s finest neighborhood: de Indische Buurt.</h3>
<p>I share my life with <a href="https://anjawaleson.notion.site/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55">Anja Waleson</a>, a high school English teacher and new ceramics enthusiast. We live in a little shoebox with a petit garden. Weâ€™re companions to puppy Lemonade, who may or may not have her own blog, <a href="https://lemonade.waleson.us">letâ€™s find out together</a>.</p>

<h3 id="in-my-spare-time-i-enjoy-swimming-writing-making-music-and-painting">In my spare time I enjoy swimming, writing, making music, and painting</h3>
<p>With generous donations from friends, I bought myself a piano for my birthday last year. Itâ€™s a journey of rediscovering how I best learn, of what draws my attention, and of how music is the best mental health item in my toolbox. For entirely archival reasons, Iâ€™m making a little EP with self-written songs this Summer.</p>

<p>Aside from music, I like to spend time writing, drawing, visiting the theatre, and swimming. With the puppy itâ€™s a bit of an adventure, but Iâ€™m hoping to settle back into my 6:30AM morning swim routine. Iâ€™ve missed swimming plenty over the winter, and it might be smart to find a good indoor pool for the later months of 2023. For now, Iâ€™m pleased to know that Amsterdamâ€™s finest outdoor pool is in our own backyard.</p>

<h3 id="im-embarking-on-a-new-professional-adventure">Iâ€™m embarking on a new professional adventure</h3>
<p>After 2.5 years with the wonderful team of <a href="https://leeruniek.nl/">Leeruniek</a> I joined <a href="https://gerimedica.nl/">Gerimedica</a> in May. Onboarding there has been an absolute dream, and Iâ€™ve felt a part of the family since the moment I signed the contract. Iâ€™ve been given plenty of space to roam around, which means that I was able to hit the ground running, teaming up with my buddy Hans to improve not only product design, but also research and evangelism.</p>

<h3 id="im-mentoring-again">Iâ€™m mentoring again</h3>
<p>After a hiatus, Iâ€™m pleased to be back on the mentoring market. With 16 years of professional experience, Iâ€™ve found that my stories, many of which I had always deemed irrelevant to the world, can be of help to other people in the IT industry, specifically UX designers and researchers and product managers. If youâ€™d like to book a session with me, you may do so via <a href="https://adplist.org/mentors/zinzy-nev-geene">ADPList</a>.</p>

<h3 id="im-doing-my-best-to-accept-the-ebb-and-flow-of-life">Iâ€™m doing my best to accept the ebb and flow of life</h3>
<p>One of the thinking traps in which I routinely fall is the one where â€œY can happen when X is completedâ€. We make a plan and God laughs. Iâ€™ve found that meditation helps me break this cycle. Iâ€™ve been devoting time daily to a meditation session. Itâ€™s becoming easier to remember that even 10 minutes of practice is worthwhile, even when I keep comparing myself to monks on some Tibetan mountain.</p>

<h3 id="im-learning-how-to-be-kind-to-my-neurodivergent-brain">Iâ€™m learning how to be kind to my neurodivergent brain</h3>
<p>Through trial and error, Iâ€™m finding ways to help myself best learn and deliver. One thing thatâ€™s been helpful in this regard is accepting my tendency to think top-down rather than bottom-up. Itâ€™s marvellous to see how much of the world assumes a bottom-up approach to learning, communicating, and creating. YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@elizabethfilips">Elizabeth Filips</a> has been of great help on this journey.</p>
