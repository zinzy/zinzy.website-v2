<h3 id="about-this-space">About this space</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This website is casual, unpretentious, and unassuming.</li>
  <li>On here, you’ll find soft stances, lived experiences, and critical notes on the things I hold dear.</li>
  <li>It’s organized as a collection of loosely linked, unfinished thoughts.</li>
  <li>I use this website to participate in the <a class="internal-link" href="/indieweb">IndieWeb</a>, a great community of people who enjoy tinkering on personal websites, as well as independence while they do so.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="technical-details">Technical details</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This website is built in <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a flat-file content management system I’ve been using for years. I like my familiarity with the platform, as well as the light-weight nature of flat-file systems.</li>
  <li>I’ve taken <a href="https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template">Maxime Vaillancourt</a> digital garden template for Jekyll as my starting point. I continue to change it on an almost daily basis.</li>
  <li>The font you’re looking at is whatever is native to your operating system.</li>
  <li>There are a few <a class="internal-link" href="/2022/11/26/notes-on-my-web-mastery">things</a> I use to keep things running smoothly.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="philosophical-considerations">Philosophical considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I believe in the idea of a singular personal website, containing details on personal and professional matters.</li>
  <li>I believe in thinking in public, and having it be an act of <a class="internal-link" href="/anti-marketing">Anti-marketing</a>. I work to make this a comfortable space where I feel no pressure to be smart, funny, insightful or anything else that I am not on a permanent basis.</li>
