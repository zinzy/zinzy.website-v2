<p>How to contact me:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Email: attach my first name to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@pm.me</code>, and itâ€™ll find its way to my inbox</li>
  <li><a href="https://mstdn.social/@zinzy">Mastodon</a>: I donâ€™t spend a ton of time here, but at least itâ€™s a two-way street</li>
