I"‹<p>I think about heritage whenever I see someoneâ€™s impressive genealogical research. As an <span title="This note is not for public consumption (yet)" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Afropean  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span> person, I struggle to make sense of what my heritage is.</p>

<p>This I know for sure:</p>
<ul>
  <li>My mother is Dutch, born in the South of the Netherlands to a woman from Voorschoten and a man from Roermond</li>
  <li>My father is SÃ£o TomÃ©an</li>
</ul>

<p>I know how to trace some of my maternal genealogy, but for my paternal lineage itâ€™s more difficult.</p>
