<p>No human experience can ever be summed up in a list of bullet points. Nevertheless, the things below you have written in earnest. Look at them whenever you need a reminder of what‚Äôs important to you.</p>

<p>Feel free to read, learn, wonder, and remember:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Statements below apply to me, and to me only, even though their phrasing is often general</li>

  <li>These things may be subject to change.</li>
