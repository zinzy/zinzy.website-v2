<p>I work at the intersection of research, design, language, and strategy, which mostly means I like a good story.</p>

<p>I have a great fondness for the creativity, potential, and independence that Internet brings us. My work aims to bring those values to people solving problems at work.</p>

<p>I currently manage design at <a class="internal-link" href="/leeruniek">Leeruniek</a>, where weâ€™re taking an interdisciplinary approach to sustainable educational data.</p>

I was born and raised in the South of the Netherlands, in a complex childhood marked by marching bands, an overabundance of food, and question marks about who, amid everybody else, I am.

I came to Utrecht to study the letters, and I enjoyed the seemingly endless learning opportunities that university life provides. I ran an absurdit magazine, worked as a freelance photographer on the side. I earned my undergraduate degree in language and literature with a thesis on focalization in the graphic novel adaptation of a Dutch classic. Narratology, adaptation, and transmediality remain some of my favorite topics.

Before I put my study books on the shelf for good, I spent a year in seminary studying theology at VU University. It taught me volumes on church history, how infinitely weird Scripture really is, and how strong one's back must be to be a queer person studying alongside young, fierce conservatives. I left after a year.

### A little magic

As an afropean queer person of color, travelling life isn't the most straightforward endeavor. In the past few years I've been involved in founding and leading queer community spaces for people to connect and recharge. As a queer facilitator, I enjoy bringing together people from all walks of life. In the Spring of 2018, I founded Queer Salon, a slow-paced gathering in Amsterdam. In 2020, on the cusp of the pandemic, I joined Vine & Fig.

### Life these days

I live on the East side of Amsterdam (which happens to be the best), where I share a shoebox and small-but-vibrant garden with my partner. I enjoy writing, which I do casually, both in diary and essay form. At heart and by training, I'm a lover of stories: the way they take shape, the things I experience with them, and the ways in which they shape societies. I also love making and writing music. I was a band geek for most of my childhood, and taught myself to play a variety of instruments. These days, I mostly focus on the guitar.
