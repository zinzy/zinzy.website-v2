I"¯<p>Reading a book on Bijlmer Bajes (a famous Amsterdam prison), and Iâ€™m chuckling at the architectâ€™s decision not to add bars to the windows, but instead rely on â€œwire alarmâ€ in the glass. Obviously it resulted in a lot of prison breaks, but what fascinates me is that the user story changed completely from a prison guard aiming to keep a prisoner from breaking out to them aiming to be alerted to a breakout attempt.</p>
