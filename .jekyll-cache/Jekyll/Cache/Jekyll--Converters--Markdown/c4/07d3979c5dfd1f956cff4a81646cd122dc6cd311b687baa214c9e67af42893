I"E<p>One of the reasons stakeholders in a product company may reject the idea of user research is that users are bad at telling you what they need. This is not a problem of the user, but of the company. Specifically, it’s the problem of the people tasked with eliciting information about users from the right places: UX professionals.</p>

<p>If your question is about what people do, it’s best to find ways to watch them do it in an environment that is as close as possible to a user’s natural environment. Don’t believe what people <em>say</em> they do, and definitely don’t believe what they will predict they <em>may</em> do in the future.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
