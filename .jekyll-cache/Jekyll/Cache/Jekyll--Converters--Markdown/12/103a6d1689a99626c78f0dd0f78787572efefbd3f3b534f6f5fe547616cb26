I"‘<p>Playing the piano is helping me put some puzzle pieces in the right place. Iâ€™ve always had the ability to reproduce the  pitch of a song, but it wasnâ€™t until I began playing the piano that I now seem able to identify the key by name. It may seem silly or small, but thatâ€™s a game-changer for me. It makes me feel that I can put everything together now; as though Iâ€™ve come full circle.</p>
