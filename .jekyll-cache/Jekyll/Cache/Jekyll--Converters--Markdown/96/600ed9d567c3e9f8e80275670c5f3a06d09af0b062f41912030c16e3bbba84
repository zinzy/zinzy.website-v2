I"¥<p>Information is useless if I manage it in such a way that Iâ€™ll lose it. Before, this note was called something like â€œtools donâ€™t matterâ€, or some other phrasing that emphasized [[tool agnosticism]]. In hindsight, that wasnâ€™t the right way to describe my thoughts. After all, tools really <em>do</em> matter to me. Itâ€™s when they no longer do that Iâ€™m reminded that information should be made to last.</p>
