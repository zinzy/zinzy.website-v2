<p>I exist at the intersection of research, design, language, and strategy, which mostly means I like to tell a good story. Firstly, I do this here, on my personal website. This website is very much a personal account of some of the areas of my life. Youâ€™ll find that I write as freely about my work as I do about my health issues. I do this in the name of integrity, not because I have a need to overshare. Check out my <a class="internal-link" href="/colophon">colophon</a> to learn more about this space.</p>

<p>I love the independence, creativity, and plurality that comes with the Internet, and I aim to bring the same to the people who use the things I make. At present, I manage design and product at Leeruniek, a startup in educational technology. Itâ€™s great to be part of a magnificent group curious folks looking to make the world better for crucial workers. Before this, I spent five years leading design at Airtrade, a market leader in travel technology. I cut my creative teeth at Studio Zinzy, which I founded in 2008 to pay not so much for the books and beers I needed in university.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in the South of the Netherlands, in a complex childhood marked by marching bands, an overabundance of food, and question marks about who, amid everybody else, I am.</p>

<p>I came to Utrecht to study the letters, and I enjoyed the seemingly endless learning opportunities that university life provides. I ran an absurdit magazine, worked as a freelance photographer on the side. I earned my undergraduate degree in language and literature with a thesis on focalization in the graphic novel adaptation of a Dutch classic. Narratology, adaptation, and transmediality remain some of my favorite topics.</p>

<p>Before I put my study books on the shelf for good, I spent a year in seminary studying theology at VU University. It taught me volumes on church history, how infinitely weird Scripture really is, and how strong oneâ€™s back must be to be a queer person studying alongside young conservative. I left after a year.</p>

<h3 id="in-life">In life</h3>
<p>I live on the East side of Amsterdam (which happens to be the best), where I share a shoebox and small-but-vibrant garden with my partner. I enjoy writing, which I do casually, both in diary and essay form. At heart and by training, Iâ€™m a lover of stories: the way they take shape, the things I experience with them, and the ways in which they shape societies. I also love making and writing music. I was a band geek for most of my childhood, and taught myself to play a variety of instruments. These days, I mostly focus on the guitar.</p>

<h3 id="at-work">At work</h3>
<p>For the past fifteen years Iâ€™ve been making a living as a researcher and designer of digital products. Iâ€™ve worked across a variety of industries, and with startups and small business owners as well as industry leaders. For the past seven years Iâ€™ve been specializing in making <a class="internal-link" href="/tools-for-people-at-work">tools for people at work</a>.</p>
