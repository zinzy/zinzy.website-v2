I"£<p>Itâ€™s late in the morning and Iâ€™m on my way to Gerimedica, the companyâ€™s Iâ€™m excited to be joining in May, which is next week already. Iâ€™m on my bike listening to an American podcast about the history of Dutch anarchist cycling culture.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> The scene could only be more Dutch if I had a frying pan with bitterballen on the back of my bike.</p>

<p>The commute is wonderful: it takes me from the East side of Amsterdam via De Pijp and Vondelpark to perhaps the most beautiful building Iâ€™ve ever had the privilege of calling my office. I cross the river Amstel, enjoy the sun, and marvel at the preparations people have been making.</p>

<p>In two days, Kingâ€™s Day is upon us. Itâ€™s always a big event in the country, and specifically in Amsterdam, and this year itâ€™s extra special: our king was coronated ten years ago this year. In our house itâ€™s not a big deal, in fact Anja couldnâ€™t be more of an anti-monarchist if she tried. Lemonadeâ€™s too young to pay it any mind, Iâ€™m sure. But the rest of the country is getting ready.</p>

<p>Kingâ€™s Day is full of traditions: young children playing the violin out of tune at the park, tompouce pastries, the king and his family on a heavily-televised trip to a Dutch city that has been preparing for this moment for a year. And forever and for always: people securing a spot on the flea market route days ahead of time.</p>

<p>Today, as I biked across the city, I saw hundreds of them; 40 square feet of pavement taped off by people aiming to use that specific spot to spend their Kingâ€™s Day. Peddling by, I thought to myself that it was a rather sweet unwritten rule: I put my name here in a manner that you could erase at any moment, but Dutch custom says youâ€™re to honor my plan.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m used to people marking these spots â€œbezetâ€ (â€œtakenâ€) or adding their name for emphasis. Today, however, I noticed many people had made a small figure with their tape, a makerâ€™s mark of sorts. Iâ€™m learning through Anjaâ€™s ceramics adventure that this is entirely common in the potter community: a small, minimalist figure telling the world you made something.</p>

<p>I hope all those people get what they came for: that specific spot on the pavement, and a fun day to help them Konmari their house. In the meantime, I also hope that the Amsterdamse Bos is quiet on Kingâ€™s Day. Iâ€™m looking to take Anja and Lemonade there for a quiet afternoon, far away from the crowds.</p>
