I"¯<p>In my journey as a human with a personal computer, and more specifically as somebody who performs <span title="This note is not for public consumption (yet)" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Knowledge work  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span>, Iâ€™ve come to prefer platform- and application-agnostic computing over anything else. When I consider using a particular app or platform, I pay close attention to how it will let me work with the things I create. This has helped me keep my writing organized since 2005.</p>

<p>Like everybody else I have tool preferences, and I get <span title="This note is not for public consumption (yet)" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Tool vibes  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span> from time to time. I prefer Spark over other email apps, I enjoy Obsidian more than other note-taking apps, and I will choose Mac OS X over any other operating system. Still, central to my choices is that I donâ€™t want any long-term engagement with products that force me to limit my opportunities.</p>

<h3 id="tools-dont-matter-means">Tools donâ€™t matter means:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I focus my attention on an object, not on the tool I can use to manipulate it (example: I keep a large collection of plain text files in my <span title="This note is not for public consumption (yet)" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Second brain  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span>. Over the years, Iâ€™ve used countless apps to manipulate these files.)</li>
  <li>With analog writing, rather than fixing myself to a particular method of archiving, or a set of writing tools (which is what a part of me desperately needs) I mix up where and how I write.</li>
  <li>I donâ€™t use desktop or smartphone apps that require me to export my data and back it up independently (example: Evernote, Moodnotes)</li>
</ul>
