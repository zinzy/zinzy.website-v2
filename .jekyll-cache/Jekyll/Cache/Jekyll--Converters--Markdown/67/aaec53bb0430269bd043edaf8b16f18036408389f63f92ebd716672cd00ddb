    <p>Thinking about visual literacy, in part because the bulk of <a href="https://anjawaleson.notion.site/Anja-Waleson-0182c8df804b4b12ab6e70b5b5795a55">Anja</a>â€™s academic work is focused on it right now, but also because I just love telling people off whenever they say that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/07/a-novel-idea-is-the-book-always-better-than-the-film">â€œthe book is better than the movieâ€</a>.</p>

    <p>Iâ€™m interested in learning about buddhism, but I donâ€™t know where to start. Everything seems either too technical or too Pinterst quotesque. A trusted source tells me Pema ChÃ¶drÃ¶n, Thich Nhat Hanh, and Herman Hesseâ€™s <em>Siddharta</em> are good entry point. Off we go.</p>

    <p>Iâ€™ve been <a class="internal-link" href="/mentoring">mentoring</a> over on <a href="https://adplist.org/mentors/zinzy-nev-geene">ADPList</a> for a while now, and I can only say Iâ€™m truly enjoying it. Itâ€™s great to work with researchers, designers, and product managers in different stages of their careers.</p>

    <p>After months of being, in essense, a recruitment manager, we added two new amazing talents to our team. I have one more role to fill, but Iâ€™m very pleased that the bulk of my time at work now goes to research, **strategy, mentoring, and operations. Feels good to be back. In all of it, Iâ€™m working to rely on my intuition, and to ask <a class="internal-link" href="/seven-questions">good questions</a>.</p>

    <p>Iâ€™ve been experimenting with new dishes:</p>

    <p><span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Teriyaki steak rolls  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span></p>

    <p><span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Miso Yaki Onigiri  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Weâ€™ve been into <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  The Staircase  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span>. I remember watching it years ago, and now that the rather satisfying HBO series is available, weâ€™re rewatching the documentary for extra context. Itâ€™s striking to see what role anti-queer rhetoric played in the investigation and media coverage.</p>

    <p>Things look a little bit different on this site, and thatâ€™s mainly because I built it again, this time using Maxime Vaillancourtâ€™s <a href="https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template">digital garden Jekyll template</a>.</p>

    <p>Attended <a class="internal-link" href="/uxinsight-festival-2022">UXInsight Festival 2022</a> and enjoyed it.</p>
