I"Š<p>Iâ€™ve updated some things around here over the weekend that I think are worth documenting. There are three major changes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Status update at the top of the page</li>
  <li>Content is now served through a submodule</li>
  <li><a href="/blogroll">Blogroll</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I love <a href="https://muan.co/">Mu-An</a>â€™s status update so much I had to have it for myself. I like the idea of fleeting messages, blurbs shouted into space, with no proper archive. I almost fool myself into thinking nobody will be able to hold me accountable for what I publish there, but we all know thatâ€™s not true.</p>

<p>I enjoy writing [[Densely-linked content]], and for this reason itâ€™s better for me to have all of my writing in a single space. My space of choice at the moment is [[Obsidian]], and thanks to <a href="https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/obsidian-github-publisher">Github Publisher</a>, an Obsidian plugin, and Tania Rasciaâ€™s <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/git-submodules-private-content/">sweet writeup on submodules</a>, I now technically donâ€™t have to be in my code base to publish content anymore.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve taking the liberty of hacking together the most obscene of deployment strategies: every time I update my status, Netlify builds my site and checks the latest updates of the submodule, publishing any new notes, posts, or pages in the process. I am not ashamed.</p>
