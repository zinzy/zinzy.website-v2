I"/<p>Inspired by <a href="https://matthewsmith.website/portfolio">Matthew Smith</a>, my initial use of the <em>Then</em> concept was as an archive of my Now page. These days, it functions more as <a href="https://piperhaywood.com/work-background/">Piper Haywood‚Äôs Work page</a> does: as a story of how I got to <a href="/now">Now</a>. Together, they make up the about page that I can never seem to finish.</p>

<p>In the Deep Dutch South, I learned to embrace the health benefits of making music, the forests of the German border, and the importance of charcuterie.</p>

<p>To account for the accent with which I speak English, I always tell people that Oprah was the only Black woman I knew growing up. It‚Äôs funny, sad, it‚Äôs true.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve always had a knack for languages, though: learning how to read, write, and speak them (usually in that order), and later, how to command them into stories that nurture conversations.</p>

<p>At Utrecht University, I dove head-first into literature and linguistics, specializing in narratology and comics studies, and running the absurdist student magazine BOMBOMMER. I graduated with a thesis on focalization in the comicized Dutch classic <em>The Evenings</em>.</p>

<p>Somehow I ended up with a degree in literature and linguistics. How is this all connected, you ask? Well, <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/12/23/UPI">naming things</a>, of course. Parallel to my hopes of becoming a humanities PhD, I had been running a design studio since I was 18. Back then, building sites and helping out startups was an easy way to make money. Eventually, it‚Äôd come to mean <a href="/work">more than just that</a>.</p>

<p>The imposter syndrome self-taught designers and researchers may feel resonates very, very deeply with me. It was until 13 years in that I began feeling like a proper designer. I‚Äôve found, though, that there is something very beautiful and effective in learning by solving your own problems. I suppose that‚Äôs also very much my learning style.</p>

<p>My understanding of how I work and what that means for my life is on a seemingly never-ending journey. Unlike what people often think when they meet me, I wasn‚Äôt blessed with a dust-free school career. I was put on the fast track for mathematics at age seven, but got bored and fannied my way through elementary school, wondering why I was so different.</p>

<p>At my edtech employer Leeruniek I always joked that I was the only person at the company who had experienced all levels of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_Netherlands">Dutch educational system</a>. My high school and college experiences were so deeply drenched in underachievement that putting them on LinkedIn would make me entirely unhireable.</p>

<p>Luckily though, I eventually made it to university, where I found the pace that was right for me.</p>
