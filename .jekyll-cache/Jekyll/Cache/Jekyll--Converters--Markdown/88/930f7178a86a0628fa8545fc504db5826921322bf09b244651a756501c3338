I"¿<p>I have a feeling 2023 will be the year for weird movies that steal our hearts. Look at <em>Triangle of Sadness</em> and <em>White Noise</em>. Here you have two high-budget oddball films that Iâ€™d describe not as mumblecore but coastercore, pulling you from one weird subnarrative into another, not really making up their minds about what they are, and before youâ€™ve formed a full opinion on it, the ride is over, but you loved it.</p>

<p>It reminds me of the dawn of black brutalist typefaces mixed with pastel and neon gradients in web design: you look at it and your body says â€œwtfâ€ and your heart goes â€œyesâ€.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll await further data to see if I have any type of a point.</p>
