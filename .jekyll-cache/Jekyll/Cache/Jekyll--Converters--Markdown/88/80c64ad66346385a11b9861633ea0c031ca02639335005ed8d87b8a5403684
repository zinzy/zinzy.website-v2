I"%<p>Hello, I’m Zinzy, and I enjoy meeting new people. If you’d like to play or learn together, have something you nee share</p>

<p>f there’s any reason you think you and I should be talking, please feel free to reach out.</p>

<p>The answer you’re looking for might be on the <a class="internal-link" href="/faq">faq</a> page.</p>

<p>The best way to contact me is by sending me an email. If you attach my first name to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@pm.me</code>, it’ll find its way to my inbox.</p>

<p>If your inquiry is related to marketing (guest posts, backlink requests, sponsored content, etc.), please see my <a href="https://piperhaywood.com/details/">policies</a>. TL;DR version: I don’t generally do that stuff, this is a personal site.</p>
