I"«<p>The menâ€™s liberation movement came on my radar in recent years as a healthy way of approaching the topic of The Patriarchyâ„¢. Itâ€™s a growing, diverse movement of people who  critique and question the surprisingly narrow boxes in which our societies tend to put men. When I got acquainted with <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  _notes/Standpoint theory  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span>, two things dawned on me:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Unlike what Iâ€™ve been taught â€” and what I in turn began to teach myself â€” cisgender, heterosexual, able-bodied, able-minded, educated, non-poor white men do not have a monopoly on the truth</li>
  <li>Western societies (and perhaps others, too) perpetuate that misconception at the expense of not only everyone who is not a cisgender, heterosexual, able-bodied, able-minded, educated, non-poor white man, but also at the expense of everyone who is</li>
</ol>

<p>I appreciate how the menâ€™s liberation movement learns from existing feminist frameworks about equality, dignity, and emancipation. Not because â€œfinally men are learning from womenâ€, but because it opens up a conversation that I didnâ€™t think possible until the birth of this movement.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve spent some time on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/">r/MensLib</a>, and enjoyed the conversations going on there.</p>
