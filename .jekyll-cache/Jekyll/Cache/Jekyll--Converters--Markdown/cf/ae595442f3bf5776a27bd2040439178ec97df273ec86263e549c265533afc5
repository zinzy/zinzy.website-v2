I"é<p>Listening to act two of <em>This American Life</em>â€™s episode <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/789/the-runaround/act-two-6">The Runaround</a>, in which we meet a boy who can only really calm his mind by running loops around the block, I canâ€™t help but wonder: itâ€™s beautiful to see a young problem-solver with ADHD make life easier for himself, but were there other people who thought of the compensatory behaviors often displayed by people with an eating disorder?</p>
