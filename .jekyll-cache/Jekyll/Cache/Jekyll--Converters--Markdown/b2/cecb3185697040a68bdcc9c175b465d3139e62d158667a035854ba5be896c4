I"—<p>After five years of learning, falling on my face, making friends, and getting to know the travel industry, the time has come for me to say goodbye to <a href="https://airtrade.com">Airtrade</a>. This year, the travel industry took a huge blow, with many of the small and big clients weâ€™ve acquired over the years in serious heavy water. Whatâ€™s more, five years is a good run, wouldnâ€™t you say?</p>
