I"±<p>I met Anja the way many people do these days: on a <a href="https://weareher.com/">dating app</a>. I was there for the obvious reasons, and she was there because a Twitter ad had distracted her from the reason she usually visited Twitter: to rant about sexism and racism.</p>

<p>The story of how we met has two deliciously distinct perspectives: I was bored, lonely, and mischievous, Anja browsed around for twelve minutes before seeing my profile picture and thinking calmly ‚Äúokay, she is the one‚Äù.</p>

<p>That was early 2016, and Anja has been my life partner ever since. She‚Äôs hilarious, compassionate, true, gorgeous, the sweetest dog mom, and so, so many other things.</p>
