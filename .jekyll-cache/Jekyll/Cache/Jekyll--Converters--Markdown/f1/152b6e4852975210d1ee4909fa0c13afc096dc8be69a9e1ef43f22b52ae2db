I"Å<p>Information is useless if I manage it in such a way that I‚Äôll lose it. Before, this note was called something like ‚Äútools don‚Äôt matter‚Äù, or some other phrasing that emphasized <span title="This note is not for public consumption (yet)" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  tool agnosticism  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span>. In hindsight, that wasn‚Äôt the right way to describe my thoughts. After all, tools really <em>do</em> matter to me. It‚Äôs when they no longer do that I‚Äôm reminded that information should be made to last.</p>

<p>When I say this, I mean that I want my information, the insights I derive from sources and experiences, to be available regardless of the tool I chose to use it with. If a platform decides it can no longer exist, I don‚Äôt want my data to go down with it, as happened with many <a href="https://indieweb.org/site-deaths">site deaths</a> in the past.</p>

<p>Dan Russell articulated this well in his <a href="https://lifehacker.com/im-dan-russell-google-research-scientist-and-this-is-1450690468">2013 <em>How I Work</em> interview with Lifehacker</a>:</p>

  <p>But you could take everything away except a loincloth and I could reboot my work environment in just an hour or so with a decent internet connection, any laptop, and a stationary store.</p>

<p>Handling information in such a way that it‚Äôs made to last helps me learn deeply about all sorts of things. It helps me see connections where I thought they didn‚Äôt exist. It helps me see how I‚Äôve developed as a human. It helps me remember what life was like for me 15 years ago. It‚Äôs not uncommon for me to come across song lyrics I wrote when I was 20, and for me to remember melody as soon as I read the words.</p>

<p>These are a few principles that help me make things to last:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Write and store information in plain text, platform-independent <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.txt</code> files</li>
  <li>Use applications that can read the contents of a folder in my operating system, a folder which I can manipulate, move, or archive at will. Don‚Äôt use applications that only support cloud-based data management such as Roam or Notion.</li>
  <li>If needed, save a link using the <a href="https://help.archive.org/help/save-pages-in-the-wayback-machine/#:~:text=Go%20to%20a%20page%20you,give%20you%20a%20permanent%20URL.">web archive functionality</a></li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt leave a trace. I aim to include as few application- or functionality-specific configurations in my notes, content that becomes obsolete as soon as I switch tools. (I‚Äôve made on exception for <a href="https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal#alternate-checkboxes">alternate checkboxes</a>, which I use in my daily notes to track tasks, priorities, and experiences)</li>
</ul>
