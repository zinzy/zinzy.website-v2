I"Ş<p>In the name of destigmatization of health issues I decided a while ago that I was going to use this website to write about what it means to have an eating disorder. This page chronicles some of the experiences I have as I go through recovery.</p>

<h3 id="meet-my-eating-disorder">Meet my eating disorder</h3>
<p>My eating disorder has developed in response to a number of (untreated) adverse childhood experiences, which left me feeling powerless, unsafe, and unimportant. The first eating disordered act I remember was at age seven, but really there is no time â€œbefore my eating disorderâ€. The first time I knew I had an eating disorder was in my early teens.</p>

<p>Or rather than â€œknewâ€ I â€œwantedâ€ one.</p>

<p>With the rise of Web 2.0, I fell into a deep hole of pro-ana Xanga blogs that showed me that having an eating disorder was glamorous, effective, and hip. A close friend and I would get together and â€œfakeâ€ having an eating disorder by carrying out associated behaviors. Things I now know to be life-threatening, and detrimental to anyoneâ€™s long-term mental health. At home, certainly dictated by <a class="internal-link" href="/diet-culture">Diet culture</a>, I began creating more and more rigorous rules</p>
