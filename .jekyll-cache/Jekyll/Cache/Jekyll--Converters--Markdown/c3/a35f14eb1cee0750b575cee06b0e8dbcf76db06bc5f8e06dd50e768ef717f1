  <li>It snowed a few times this week and I was as baffled as I always am to see it happening in March. I donâ€™t have a great understanding of what the weatherâ€™s supposed to do in a given period of the year.</li>
  <li>After two weeks of cocooning, weâ€™ve finally been taking Lemonade out to various places. I aim to take her out at least once a day, usually to the park or a walk around the block. We also visited my favorite coffee place twice. Itâ€™s wonderful to see sheâ€™s such a relaxed and curious dog.</li>
  <li>This was my last full week off. I still have a few days left and then I head back into work. I donâ€™t know how people work after they first got a puppy, and Iâ€™m grateful I was able to take this time off.</li>
  <li>I attended service at All Saints again. It was an intimate gathering with a rather inspiring reflection comparing â€œgiving upâ€ to â€œletting goâ€ for Lent. I feel like I never get Lent right: I drop in too late, donâ€™t see it all the way through, and this always makes me feel like Iâ€™m not a proper Christian. Regardless, itâ€™s great to become acquainted with All Saints. Its focus on inclusivity gives me goosebumps.</li>
  <li>Lemonade met the other corgi in the building, Lalo. At only ten weeks older than she is, he towered over her as they played, but she didnâ€™t let that bother her. He was so sweet playing with her, using his strength in a very gentle way. Hereâ€™s to hoping theyâ€™ll become best friends.</li>
  <li><a href="https://anneliewambeek.com">Annelie</a> came over for tea and lemon punitions. She had been gone for a few weeks and I had missed her. Sheâ€™s Lemonadeâ€™s godmother, and as they met in real life for the first time it was clear to see why this is so.</li>
  <li>Anja started her ceramics course at Studio Pansa. On Sunday she had her second class, and she took pictures. Sheâ€™s such a fast learner, and the pots she made came out beautifully. Iâ€™m proud of her.</li>
