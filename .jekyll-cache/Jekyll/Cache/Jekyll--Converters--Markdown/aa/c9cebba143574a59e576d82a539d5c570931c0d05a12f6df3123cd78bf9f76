I"™<p>As a designer, I am very much not the first one to consider that treating people like users invokes unappetizing metaphors:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The user as an addict:</strong> with a revenue model that requires boundless growth, design decisions seemingly neglect to ask whether increased engagement with a product is effective in one‚Äôs grander scheme of things</li>
  <li><strong>The user as a number</strong></li>
</ul>

  <p>4/ I remember when we moved from strict reverse-chron (which 97% struggle with) to ‚ÄúYou might like‚Äù prompts (which 3% struggle with) and hearing from the VERY LOUD minority that we were destroying Twitter. But we saw as the 97% had a much better time. We saw that every step forward we took (I have a whole presentation on this) was helping people more and more.The data told us we were making a better product. And that reverse-chron kinda sucks. For most people.</p>
