I"Â<h1 id="ali-and-ava">Ali and Ava</h1>
<p>I went to see this film on May 26, 2022, thinking it would be a bit of a boring rom com. I couldnâ€™t have been more wrong, but Iâ€™m chalking it up to my lack of exposure to art house cinema during the pandemic. Iâ€™ve seen it in the theatre three times so far, and it might be my favorite film of the year.</p>

<p>The story of Ali and Ava lingers like a Zadie Smith novel. Itâ€™s kind, newly sincere, and quiet. Thereâ€™s something very refreshing about seeing a story of love play out across ethnic and cultural differences without the whole thing falling into the type of racial tensions particular to the context of the United States. Itâ€™s an unromcom.</p>
