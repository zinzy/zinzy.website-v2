I"İ<p>Saw this movie on <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  2022-12-19  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span> at <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Studio K  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span>, expecting something slightly weird about a cruise. Itâ€™s a good thing I stopped reading after that, because the pirates and the land mine, the resulting ship wreck and ensuing <em>Survivor</em> narrative were quite the thrill. I love about this movie the diffuse accents (although Iâ€™m sure A. wouldâ€™ve pointed out Charlbi Dean Kriekâ€™s South-African accent within minutes), reminds me vaguely of that German show <em>Dark</em>. Thought I recognized Harris Dickinson, and learned later itâ€™s from <em>Beach Rats</em>, which I think I mustâ€™ve given up on halfway through.</p>

<p>I laughed loudly, perhaps a little too loudly, at the shit and vomit scenes, the hallway and bathroom shots of which invoked <em><span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Titanic  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span></em> vibes for me. I also laughed loudly every time the woman who could only utter â€œIn den Wolkenâ€ did so in the most non sequitur of ways.</p>

<p>The film had something <em>Mother!</em>-esque about it: slices of life tumbling into chaos.</p>

<p>Some other things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Toxic femininity (Yaya and later Abigail)</li>
  <li>The racism scene reminded me of â€œ<a class="internal-link" href="/the-good-men">The good men</a>â€</li>
</ul>
