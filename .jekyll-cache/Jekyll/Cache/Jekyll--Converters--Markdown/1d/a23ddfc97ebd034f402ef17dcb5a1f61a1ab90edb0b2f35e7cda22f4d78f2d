I"<p>As soon as she hands you the gift<br />
you know itâ€™s another one<br />
â€œTrans Life Survivorsâ€<br />
says the cover<br />
â€œMerry Christmas!â€<br />
says your sister<br />
you have only been using<br />
they/them pronouns<br />
in private<br />
for a year or so<br />
itâ€™ll look so beautiful next to<br />
the ex-gay book<br />
your other sister presented to you<br />
on your birthday last month</p>
