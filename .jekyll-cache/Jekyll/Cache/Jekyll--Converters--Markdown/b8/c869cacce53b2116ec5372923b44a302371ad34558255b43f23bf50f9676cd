I"3<p>Sometimes I zoom out of the daily reality of my life to remind myself that I hate dogs. I’ve always hated dogs. I hate all dogs except corgis. On top of all of these strong feelings, I’m a cat person. All of this goes to show how peculiar it is that Anja and I adopted a dog in February of 2023.</p>
