I"è<p>Everyone I know has a strong opinion on Amsterdam. Thereâ€™s no â€œmeh, whateverâ€. People either love it or love to leave it. Some reasons I know people love Amsterdam: access to cultural events and places, big city many people, things <em>happen</em> here.</p>

<p>I love Amsterdam because of how I fit in here. Having grown up in the southern countryside, I love that, as a fat queer person of color, I donâ€™t really stand out in this city. People mind their business, but not so much that I feel isolated.</p>
