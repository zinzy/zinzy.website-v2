I"`<p>I saw this film at <span title="This note is not for public consumption (yet)" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Filmhallen  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span> on <span title="This note is not for public consumption (yet)" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  2023-08-25  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span>.</p>

<p>What is interesting to me — and I have yet to learn of any specific language I can use for such occasions — that, every few years, a horror movie is released that is quickly dubbed “the scariest movie of [the year / the decade / all time]”, when one could seriously argue whether this is the case. I’m suspecting this is because Western culture traditionally regards horror movies as low-brow media, <a class="internal-link" href="/silly-archives">Silly archives</a>, or simply bad storytelling. Perhaps the only descriptor we have for a good horror movie is that it’s the scariest. I should probably move this paragraph to a note called something like <span title="This note is not for public consumption (yet)" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Art horror  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span>.</p>
