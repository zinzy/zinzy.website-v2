I"•<p>Sometimes I<br />
feel that I am<br />
a <br />
bad<br />
Black<br />
girl<br />
because whenever<br />
my white girlfriend<br />
and I sift through<br />
Netflix<br />
Prime Video<br />
or anything<br />
with a reasonable trial<br />
period<br />
and she says ‚Äúlet‚Äôs <br />
watch this<br />
movie or that‚Äù<br />
featuring Black stories <br />
I instead<br />
elect to watch a white<br />
narrative<br />
because it‚Äôs nice<br />
to forget <br />
about <br />
racism<br />
and the teacher<br />
who called me <br />
a monkey<br />
and<br />
the no one<br />
who called him<br />
out<br />
and<br />
being a bit<br />
Black<br />
and being<br />
a bit<br />
white</p>
