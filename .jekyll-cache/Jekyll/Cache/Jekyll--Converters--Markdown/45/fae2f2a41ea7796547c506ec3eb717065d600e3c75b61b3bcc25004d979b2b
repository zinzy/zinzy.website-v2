I"∂<p>I grew up on the Internet in a time when social media meant writing comments on other people‚Äôs hand-built blogs. I remember a sense of whimsy, endless curiosity, and a beautiful lack of information overload. It instilled in me a deep appreciation for hand-crafted websites. This is one of them.</p>

<h3 id="principles">Principles</h3>
<p>I believe things on the web should be <mark>accessible, transparent, and sustainable</mark>. In making this website, I do my best to keep in mind the following sources of inspiration:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://brutalist-web.design/">Brutalist web design principles</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/">The a11y project</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/">Designed to last</a></li>

</ul>

<h3 id="the-story-this-space-tells">The story this space tells</h3>
<p>One element about web publishing that has forever been intriguing me is the question of online identity. As an adult person with hobbies, a career, and various interests, I routinely wonder what I should put on my website, what I should leave out, what style of design I should implement and why. What does this space say about my person? What does it say about my skills as a professional designer?</p>

<p>When it comes down to it, this I know: I believe it‚Äôs good to have a single website that serves as my home on the web rather than separate websites for my professional and personal lives. I also believe that it‚Äôs okay to use this space to be vulnerable, lack awareness, and change my mind.</p>

<h3 id="content">Content</h3>
<p>There are three main content types on this website:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Journal entries, some fleeting, some crafted with great focus, all of which are collected under <a href="/writing">Writing</a></li>
  <li>Short blurbs, reflections, reminders, and notes to friends, which I store in <a href="/changelog">my changelog</a></li>
  <li>Working notes of topics I think about frequently, collected in <a href="/garden">my garden</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>
<p>Currently this website sports a brutalist single-column design. It‚Äôs a humble form of activism of mine to combat the pressure my fellow UX designers and I feel about personal branding.</p>

<p>I love narrow, single-column personal websites. They tell me: ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôm just a person like you, and this is a way for you to get to know me a bit better. All you have to do is knock, I‚Äôll always open the door.‚Äù I truly hope this website invokes a similar vibe for you.</p>

<p>I usually refrain from using custom CSS or content in my diary entries.</p>

<p>Much like you, I assume, I don‚Äôt like being tracked on the Internet. There would be countless things I could learn from having analytics running on this website, but since quantitative analysis is a solid part of my day job, I like to keep the mystery alive in my private affairs. <a href="https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2020/01/i-dont-track-you-here-but-others-might/">I don‚Äôt track you, but others might</a>.</p>
