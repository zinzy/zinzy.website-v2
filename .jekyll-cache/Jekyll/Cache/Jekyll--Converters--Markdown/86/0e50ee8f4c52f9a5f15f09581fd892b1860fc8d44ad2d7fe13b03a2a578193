I"Û<p>This page is part of Derek Siversâ€™ <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">Now</a> movement. It contains a rough overview of what Iâ€™m up to or whatâ€™s top of mind for me at any given point in time. Traditionally, a now page is updated without maintaining an archive, but I like to see where Iâ€™ve come from.</p>

<h3 id="where-i-am">Where I am</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Iâ€™m back at work <a class="internal-link" href="/leeruniek">Leeruniek</a>. After some time spent ruthlessly prioritizing my health, Iâ€™m excited to get my hands dirty again. Returning to <a class="internal-link" href="/design">Design</a> work feels like a warmth bath.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="where-my-focus-is">Where my focus is</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Enjoying Amsterdamâ€™s cultural opportunities by attending some fun events. Check my <a class="internal-link" href="/what-i-consume">What I consume</a> page for details.</li>
  <li>I continue working hard to better manage my health (predominantly my <a class="internal-link" href="/eating-disorder">Eating disorder</a>), which takes a lot of patience, faith, and guts.</li>
  <li>Iâ€™m invested in my <a class="internal-link" href="/yoga">Yoga</a> and <a class="internal-link" href="/meditation">Meditation</a> practice</li>
</ul>
