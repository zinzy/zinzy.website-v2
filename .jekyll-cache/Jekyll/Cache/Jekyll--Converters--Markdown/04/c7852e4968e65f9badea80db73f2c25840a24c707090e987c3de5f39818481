I"‡<p>Hey there, Iâ€™m Zinzy. I got a toy piano at the age four, and Iâ€™ve been a band geek ever since. I taught myself to play most wind, a few percussion, and a number of string instruments. The instrument I longed for most as a child was a piano. In my working class family home, an oft-heard response to my piano pleads were â€œpianos are for rich people, Zinzyâ€. As a young girl, I promised myself that Iâ€™d one day buy myself a piano.</p>

<p>On my 35th birthday I gave myself what I promised.</p>

<p>Below youâ€™ll find rough notes of what Iâ€™m learning.</p>

  <li>Iâ€™m a fan of teaching myself how to play instruments, so I didnâ€™t opt for in-person or private piano lessons. Instead, I purchased an annual subscription from Pianote.
