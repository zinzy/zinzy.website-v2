I"Õ<p>Recently, Iâ€™ve been making some great progress with my personal website. While I normally donâ€™t engage in technical ballets on the goings-on of this website, I feel itâ€™s relevant to document what Iâ€™ve learnt and done, if only for posterity.</p>

<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>: as is often the case for me, this site is built using my favorite flat-file content management system</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>: hosts the code for this website</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>: serves the content to my website</li>
  <li><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>: I write in a single Obsidian vault</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git">obsidian-git</a>: helps me manage  the version control of my Obsidian content</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/push-git-subdirectory-as-branch">Push git subdirectory as branch</a>: a Github action that lets me publish a part of the content of my Obsidian vault to a separate repository</li>
  <li><a href="https://mtsknn.fi/blog/netlify-updating-private-git-submodule/">Git submodule</a>: my separate repository is pulled into my websiteâ€™s code base</li>
  <li><a href="https://mtsknn.fi/blog/how-to-trigger-daily-netlify-builds-using-github-actions/">Netlify build hook</a>: every day, Netlify looks for new content and publishes it to my website</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-this-is-great">Why this is great</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I hold the strong belief that <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  * Tools donâ€™t matter  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span>. This means, among other things, that I donâ€™t like to be limited to using particular platforms or apps to write. I want to see my files in a folder that I can move around. Jekyll allows me to do just this.</li>
  <li>My website is a text-heavy space: most of what youâ€™ll find on here is written content. As a knowledge worker, writing is an integral part of my daily life. Many of the things I write are not for public consumption, but they are closely linked to things that <em>are</em>. To avoid duplicate content and awkward linking, it was important for me to manage my text files in a single space, one Obsidian vault.</li>
  <li>I have a tendency to tinker a lot on my website. This can make it so that I spend more time trying out new things and changing the design than I do writing. Having my code base and content separated helps me focus more on writing things that are meaningful to me.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="some-things-i-havent-figured-out-yet">Some things I havenâ€™t figured out yet</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Is it worthwhile for me to publish more granular IndieWeb post types such as notes and likes? Do I care about them? Am I making them only to show them? Whatâ€™s their value if I cannot automate this process? Does the technical implementation change if I push said content to a git repository that consists of only notes?</li>
  <li>What does a proper dark mode look like?</li>
  <li>Do I want to continue my barebones experiment and document the <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  Discomfort of vanity  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span>? Or am I ready for something more modern?</li>
  <li>How in the world do I even go about Micropub and Webmentions?</li>
</ul>
