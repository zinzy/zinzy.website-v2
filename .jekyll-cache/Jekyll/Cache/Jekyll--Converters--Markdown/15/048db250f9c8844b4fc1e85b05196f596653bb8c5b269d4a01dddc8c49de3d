<p>I met Shervin at the coffee place this morning. We know each other very casually; we used to frequent the same co-working space, weâ€™re LinkedIn friends. He has one of those faces that you just want to meet with a smile.</p>

<p>We exchange how life is treating us, what weâ€™re doing at work. He tells me about his side projects, and how one of them is an invite-only meetup where you attend without knowing what youâ€™ll be doing. He lets me in on secrets around the next meetup, and tells me what kind of activities are involved. It sounds magical.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s beauty in the not knowing, we agree. In the whimsy of the unexpected, the sudden connection we may feel with other humans. I tell him his project reminds me of Marina AbramoviÄ‡, whom Anja and I were fortunate enough to meditate with <a href="https://carre.nl/pagina/marina-in-carre">in Carre last year</a>. Participating in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/nyregion/04about.html">her famous eye-gazing practice</a> with complete strangers was transformative.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m glad I got an invitation.</p>
