I"<p>Introduced by Michael Bungay Stanier, the seven questions can help people, particularly those in leadership positions, become better at helping others.</p>

<ol>
  <li>What’s on your mind?</li>
  <li>And what else?</li>
  <li>What’s the real challenge here for you?</li>
  <li>What do you want</li>
  <li>How can I help?</li>
  <li>If you’re saying yes to this, what are you saying no to?</li>
  <li>What was most useful for you?</li>
</ol>

<p>I first learned about this concept while listening to <span title="There is no note that matches this link." class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">[[</span>  dare-to-lead-the-advice-trap|”Dare to Lead”’s episode on the advice trap’  <span class="invalid-link-brackets">]]</span></span>.</p>
