I"<p>Inspired by a <a href="https://robhope.com/graveyard">few</a> <a href="https://www.danielzarick.com/failed/">good</a> <a href="">people</a>, I maintain an overview of projects in which I’ve been involved. I love personal websites that aren’t just a highlight reel of someone’s life, but that instead give a glimpse into someone’s actual life. The projects below were all part of my life at one point or another. If you’d like to learn more about them, <a href="/hello">get in touch</a>.</p>

<h3 id="️-shutting-up-with-god-2021">🎙️ Shutting up with God (2021)</h3>
<p>A podcast about prayer on which I wanted to interview people that would remind the listener that Christianity is not a heteronormative monolith. I was looking forward to cohosting this with my friend Mary. Career opportunities got in the way of the project.</p>

<h3 id="️-7-things-that-make-me-feel-guilty-2021">🎙️ 7 Things That Make Me Feel Guilty (2021)</h3>
<p>A podcast on which I would interview queer Catholics about things that make them feel guilty. Originated with the idea that learning about each other’s vulnerabilities is a great way to see ourselves in others. I recorded a first season with a well-received pilot, but life got in the way and I never ended up releasing the episodes.</p>

<h3 id="-manifold-2019">☕ Manifold (2019)</h3>
<p>An Amsterdam Meetup for queer Christians of color. They were hard to find.</p>

<h3 id="-qpoc-reading-club-2018-2019">📚 QPOC Reading Club (2018-2019)</h3>
<p>An Amsterdam Meetup for queer people of colors that gathered once a month to discuss an antiracist, queer-friendly text.</p>

<h3 id="-asocialcall-2020">✌🏽 #asocialcall (2020)</h3>
<p>A little branded initiative I started on Instagram to keep up people’s spirits when the pandemic broke out. Consisted of people using the hashtag <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#asocialcall</code> to find strangers to have short Zoom calls with.</p>

<h3 id="-inclusive-workspace-2019---2020">✊🏽 Inclusive Workspace (2019 - 2020)</h3>
<p>Frustrated by a sudden burst of straight White people changing their careers to consultancy in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), I created a platform to showcase the many (queer) people of color I know who already excel at this work. Things were going well, and then there was Covid.</p>

<h3 id="️-wtf-bible-2013">✏️ WTF Bible (2013)</h3>
<p>A domain name I registered on a whim which I would use to blog about weird things I found in the Bible. There were too many things and I didn’t know where to begin.</p>

<h3 id="-unnamed-journalistic-platform-2013">📰 Unnamed journalistic platform (2013)</h3>
<p>After being approached by a team of young journalists, I worked on a platform to bring investigative journalism to a younger audience. In the Autumn of the year, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Correspondent">De Correspondent</a> was launched.</p>

<h3 id="-de-webtraining-2011---2014">🧑🏽‍🏫 De Webtraining (2011 - 2014)</h3>
<p>Together with a friend, I developed a series of workshops to teach young business owners how to use the Internet to their advantage.</p>

<h3 id="-bombommer-2010---2013">📰 BOMBOMMER (2010 - 2013)</h3>
<p>A university buddy and I ran this fairly successful absurdist student magazine.</p>

<h3 id="️-huis-van-jis-2010">✏️ Huis van Jis (2010)</h3>
<p>Together with a friend and a roommate, I wrote a fictional letter exchange between three college friends.</p>
