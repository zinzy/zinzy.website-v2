I"œ<p>More than any other time in my online life am I aware of the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text. I make a point to write image descriptions whenever I can. Kind strangers with a variety of accessibility needs have been helping me understand how to best capture the story an image tells for me. Iâ€™ve come to regard <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text as a secret side bar I get to have with blind people and others who need it.</p>

<p>For me, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text raises interesting cultural questions, particularly around its growing visibility. Traditionally, it requires people who donâ€™t use accessibility tools to hover an image to produce what I call â€œthe worldâ€™s slowest tooltipâ€. In addition, Iâ€™ve been seeing a growing number of people work <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alt</code> text into places where it doesnâ€™t exist. Places that donâ€™t require a hover. Two examples of this are <a href="https://tech.lgbt/@zinzy">Mastodon</a>â€™s profile and banner images.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I saw the profile picture of a young woman winking at the camera, in a manic pixie dream girl kind of way, but you still remembered sheâ€™s a three-dimensional character. Her profile bio captured the image with something like â€œyoung woman looking seductively at the camera, winking, and slightly sticking out her tongue hoping to engage the onlookerâ€. Before reading that text I felt engaged indeed, my mind painting a quick image of what her interesting, wonderful, poetry slam, university campus life would be like.</p>

<p>Reading her description of the image changed my take immediately. I gather it was the overtness â€” her self-awareness about what they image could convey â€” that somehow put me off a little bit. It took away the mystery of this Internet person I didnâ€™t know. Made her an actual woman behind a screen, with a life as complex as mine. I certainly didnâ€™t like her less, but I felt disenchanted with the person her image had created for me.</p>

<p>What does it mean, Iâ€™ve been thinking ever since, that we get to</p>
