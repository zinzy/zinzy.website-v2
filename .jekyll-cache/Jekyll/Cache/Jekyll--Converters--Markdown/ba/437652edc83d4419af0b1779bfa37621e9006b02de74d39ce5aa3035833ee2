<h3 id="what-i-do">What I do</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>Tactical UX research and design</dt>
  <dd>I don’t do UX for the sake of it, but instead deploy my [[UX toolkit]] to solve a wide variety of problems that may exist at companies making digital products.</dd>
  <dt>Enterprise SaaS</dt>
  <dd>Products that fascinate me are usually complex, data-heavy tools used by people to solve problems at work.</dd>
  <dt>Impact-driven teams</dt>
  <dd>I love products that contribute to making the world a better place. More practically, I enjoy contributing specifically to those products that amplify and simplify the jobs of essential workers.</dd>
