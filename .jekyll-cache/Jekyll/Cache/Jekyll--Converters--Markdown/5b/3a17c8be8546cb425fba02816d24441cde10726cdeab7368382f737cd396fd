I"Ö<p><a class="internal-link" href="/about">My</a> second brain is a large collection of plain text files that I maintain as a repository for things I would like to retrieve later but donâ€™t want to remember now. The public part of it can be found on this website, my <a href="/digital-garden">digital garden</a>.</p>

<p>â€œSecond brainâ€ is just a nifty new term for a concept thatâ€™s been around for ages: the commonplace book, and later â€” I fantasize about Wall Street in the 90s with Filofax when I hear this term â€” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_information_management">personal information management</a>. These days, thereâ€™s a lot of talk online about personal knowledge management, but frankly, that term erks me a bit. It feels like people everywhere, including those with little original writing, have coopted the term from academics, and that makes me cringe. Nevertheless, here I am.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s important for me to remember <a class="internal-link" href="/tools-don-t-matter">Tools donâ€™t matter</a>. The only thing that matters about a tool is that it must allow me to manipulate plain text or Markdown files that exist in a folder that I can move around freely.</p>
