  <li><del>I have the vague assumption that this course is very much about ethical challenges <em>in</em> or <em>through</em> ethnographic research. While thinking about my talk, I organically landed in the area of ethical challenges <em>solved by</em> ethnographic research. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs even something you‚Äôre interested in. Please let me know.</del></li>
  <li><del>I could easily fill 30 minutes on this talk setup. There‚Äôs a little bit of interaction up front, because I‚Äôd want to get a sense of what their perspectives are on this method.</del></li>

  <li>There are two gripes that I seem to be playing with here:
    <ul>
      <li>product can‚Äôt do without UX</li>
      <li>UX can‚Äôt do without anthropology</li>
      <li>It‚Äôs probably best to keep it clean and cut the second
        <h3 id="initial-ideas">Initial ideas</h3>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What steps do we take to ensure our research is ethical?</li>
  <li>What ethical challenges are produced by research?</li>
  <li>What ethical challenges are produced by a lack of research?
    <ul>
      <li>Thinking <em>for</em> users</li>
      <li>Operating on the assumption that users can‚Äôt tell us what they want because we don‚Äôt use the appropriate methods</li>
      <li>Enterprise UX lends itself to unethical product practices by installing consultants to act on behalf of users, as ‚Äúsmarter, better informed, better educated‚Äù versions of them</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Getting buy-in for ethnographic research is difficult in enterprise SaaS because subject matter experts ‚Äúget in the way‚Äù (‚Äúresearch for the sake of research‚Äù)</li>
  <li>What ethical challenges can impact-driven startups run into (while thinking they‚Äôre ethical by virtue of impact-driven nature?)</li>
</ul>

  <li>Le Guin‚Äôs story reminds me so much of what happens in Big Tech: looking at it from the outside, it seems as though designers either drink the Kool-Aid or walk away entirely. Does anybody stay and fight?</li>
