I"š<p>Inspired by <a href="https://matthewsmith.website/portfolio">Matthew Smith</a>, my initial use of the <em>Then</em> concept was as an archive of my Now page. These days, it functions more as <a href="https://piperhaywood.com/work-background/">Piper Haywoodâ€™s Work page</a> does: as a story of how I got to <a href="/now">Now</a>. Together, they make up the about page that I can never seem to finish.</p>
