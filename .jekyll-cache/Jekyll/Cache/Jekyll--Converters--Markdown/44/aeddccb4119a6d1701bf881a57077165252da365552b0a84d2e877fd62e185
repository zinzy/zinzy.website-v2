I" <p>I maintain this page as an incomplete overview of the things I love to use. Kind of like <a href="https://usesthis.com/">Uses This</a>, but they havenâ€™t requested an interview yet. Before you dive in, please know that I believe (and tell myself in the mirror that) tools donâ€™t matter. I donâ€™t list all the tools I use (you donâ€™t care that I have an iPhone), just the ones I think you might find useful.</p>
