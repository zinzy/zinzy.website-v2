  <li>The first week back at work is fairly quiet, I even found myself on the verge of boredom at one point. Organically, this makes me feel bad, but I remind myself that weeks before and after holidays tend to have this effect on my life. I tell myself Iâ€™m just landing.</li>
  <li>No one can convince me the municipality of Amsterdam <em>isnâ€™t</em> using major construction projects to show tourists how crap the city can be. On Sunday, I go for a long bike ride to Amsterdamse Bos and back, and crossing the Berlagebrug Iâ€™m struck by how quiet the street is without cars racing by. I like it.</li>
  <li>I finished watching <em><span title="This note is not for public consumption (yet)" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  The Righteous Gemstones  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span></em>, and I miss them already.</li>
  <li>Anjaâ€™s still off for the summer, and Iâ€™m watching her slowly recover from being my personal chauffeur for two weeks</li>
  <li>The Summer makes me not want to cook. Itâ€™s no help that Iâ€™m using <a href="https://anneliewambeek.com/">Annelie</a>â€™s apartment to work while sheâ€™s travelling, and that I use the occasion to order poke bowls for lunch. Iâ€™m surprised by the quality of <a href="https://pokeperfect.nl/en/amsterdam/linnaeusstraat/">Poke Perfect</a>â€™s teriyaki chicken bowl, extra edamame.</li>
  <li>Iâ€™m reading and enjoying Robin Meyerâ€™s <em><span title="This note is not for public consumption (yet)" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Saving Jesus From the Church  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span></em>, a tool to make my interest in <span title="This note is not for public consumption (yet)" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  orthopraxy  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span> more tangible.</li>
