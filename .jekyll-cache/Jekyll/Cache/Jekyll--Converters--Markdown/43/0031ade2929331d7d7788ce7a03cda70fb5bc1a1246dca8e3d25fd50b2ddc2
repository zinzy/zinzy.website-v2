I"Ü<p>This is the term I use to refer to changes designers wish to push through in a product development cycle without those changes being a part of the requirements.</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

<h4 id="design-system-changes">Design system changes</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>I changed something in the design system, and it should be incorporated as part of this feature story</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Iâ€™ve found that, when product owners assess the scope of a story or epic and prioritize it appropriately, theyâ€™re usually not thinking about how these efforts will affect a design system.</p>

<p>If I want to propose a change to the design system, itâ€™s best for me to discuss this with the product owners and relevant developers, so that everyone is on the same page. This gives the product owner the opportunity to opt into the change, and for the developers to estimate the effort accordingly.</p>

<h4 id="ux-writing">UX writing</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>I decided on this UX copy, I expect it will be implemented as part of a feature story</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some designers I know are very language-oriented. And most of us have learnt to <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/lorem-ipsum-will-destroy-your-design-11b3dc3ba721">scoff at lorem ipsum</a>, and rightfully so. Despite text being a fundamentally interactive aspect of digital product design, companies donâ€™t naturally assume that UX designers will know a thing or two about it.</p>

<p>In my experience, coworkers, especially account managers and product owners, have strong opinions on what text should be used for micro copy or for longer bodies of text. Iâ€™ve always gauged that this might be because, of all the visual things in a product, copy is the easiest thing one can form an opinion on without having had training on the matter.</p>

<p>When writing UX copy, I want to take care of two things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>I want UX copy to be a part of our design system, so that designers donâ€™t have to reinvent the wheel with every new feature</li>
  <li>I work to find close alignment with stakeholders who I know hold strong opinions on UX copy</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="similar-features-with-longer-hair">Similar features <a href="https://youtu.be/i0HCOS4nbzU">(with longer hair)</a></h4>
<p>A near-perfect scenario for feature sneak to find its way into a design is when a designer, while working on solving a particular problem, strays slightly and finds another element or functionality that may require some design work. This could help the designer feed two birds with one scone, but in the worst case the design hand-off will include pixel-perfect prototypes of an entire page or section of a product.</p>

<p>Whenever I run into something like this, I ask myself whether I have faith in my teamâ€™s ability to prioritize this perceived enhancement at a later time. If so, I donâ€™t start working on it at all. If I feel more comfortable including it in my design, Iâ€™ll discuss with my product owner if thereâ€™s space for it in this development effort.</p>
