  <li>If you ever happen to find yourself in the sleepy fishing town of IJmuiden: the fish, service, atmosphere, and cheesecake in the fish restaurantÂ <a href="http://www.meerplaats.nl/">De Meerplaats</a>Â are all very pleasant.</li>
  <li>For my birthday,Â <a href="http://www.zinnigverhaal.nl/">Erica Bouma</a>Â gave meÂ <em>Jesus</em>Â by rebel theologian Hans KÃ¼ng. Itâ€™s a great and easy read â€” a recommendation for anybody interested in the history of Christianity.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.vpro.nl/speel.program.27507738.html"><em>The Son and the Stranger</em></a>Â is a beautifulÂ Dutch-languageÂ documentary about Daan, a man who, after studying Hebrew in university, converted to the ultra orthodox Jewish faith. Filmmaker Thomas Vroege attempts to understand his motives.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2600742/"><em>Ghost Shark</em></a>, in which the translucent, bright blue ghost of a murdered shark jumps up from the smallest water surfaces to eat innocent holiday goers, is the worst worst Syfy-film of 2013. With a comeback fromÂ <em>7th Heaven</em>â€˜s youngest daughter. Totally worth the choke by laughter, though.</li>
  <li>I think Noah Kalinaâ€™s photo seriesÂ <a href="http://noahkalina.com/36/39#1"><em>Internet/Sex (2007-2009)</em></a>Â is something very special.</li>
  <li>My poet friend Jelmer van Lenteren runs a very niceÂ <a href="http://ikzitookop.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>, where he shares his beautiful work and many great music tips.</li>
