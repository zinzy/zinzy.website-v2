I"i<p>Hey Ornella, as promised a small introduction into the world of personal knowledge management (PKM):</p>

<ul>
  <li>PKM helps us collect, classify, save, search, find, and share information</li>
  <li>By taking atomic notes and densely linking them we can come to new ideas</li>
  <li>There are many PKM tools available, each very advanced and functionality-rich in their own way</li>
  <li>The easiest, and cheapest, way to get started with PKM is by downloading Obsidian</li>
  <li>You may want to download their <a href="https://obsidian.md/download">Windows</a> app</li>
  <li>If you use a cloud service like Dropbox, you can easily back up your notes</li>
  <li>I think you may enjoy <a href="https://writingcooperative.com/note-taking-is-not-enough-knowledge-management-for-researchers-and-writers-319acec1fc2e">this article on PKM for researchers</a></li>
