<p>I went to see this film on <span title="This note is not for public consumption (yet)" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  2022-05-06  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span>, thinking it would be a bit of a boring <span title="This note is not for public consumption (yet)" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Rom-com  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span>. I couldnâ€™t have been more wrong, but Iâ€™m chalking it up to my lack of exposure to <span title="This note is not for public consumption (yet)" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Art house cinema  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span> during <span title="This note is not for public consumption (yet)" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  the Pandemic  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span>. Iâ€™ve seen it in the theatre three times so far, and it might be my favorite film of the year.</p>

<p>The story of Ali and Ava lingers like a <span title="This note is not for public consumption (yet)" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  Zadie Smith  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span> novel. Itâ€™s kind, newly sincere, and quiet. Thereâ€™s something very refreshing about seeing a story of love play out across ethnic and cultural differences without the whole thing falling into the type of racial tensions particular to the context of the <span title="This note is not for public consumption (yet)" class="invalid-link">  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span>  United States  <span class="invalid-link-brackets"></span></span>. Itâ€™s an unromcom.</p>
