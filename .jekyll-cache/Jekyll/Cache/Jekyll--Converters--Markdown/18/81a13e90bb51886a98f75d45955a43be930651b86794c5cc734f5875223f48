<p>In simple terms, the webmention is a nerdy way of speaking to other people’s personal websites. Rather than writing a comment on a page, liking it, or sending the maker an email about it, we use the webmention to publish a response on our own website, and then send it in a special way.</p>

<p>“Special way” is a euphemism for how difficult it can be to set up webmentions.</p>

<p>My strategy currently consists of automatically receiving and displaying incoming webmentions. Any outgoing webmentions, sadly, are sent manually. I’m hoping to change that in the future.</p>

<ul>
  <li><del>When someone sends a webmention to one of my paged, either manually or automatically, Netlify will see it, because it checks for new webmentions every time I deploy my website using the <a href="https://www.netlify.com/integrations/community-built/webmentions-build-plugin/">Webmentions build plugin</a> .</del></li>
  <li><del>Because it’s fetched during deployment, the webmention is automatically displayed on my website, because I use <a href="http://beesbuzz.biz/">fluffy</a>’s <a href="https://github.com/PlaidWeb/webmention.js">webmention.js</a>.</del></li>
  <li>When looking up how my webmentions work for <a href="https://elliott.computer/">Elliott</a>, I incorrectly thought Netlify does anything to receive webmentions, but that’s incorrect.</li>
  <li><a href="https://webmention.io/">Webmention.io</a> collects incoming webmentions for me.</li>
  <li>I display them on my website using <a href="http://beesbuzz.biz/">fluffy</a>’s <a href="https://github.com/PlaidWeb/webmention.js">webmention.js</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whenever I want to send a webmention to someone, perhaps because I’m replying to their content specifically (rather than mentioning their website in passing), I’ll send it via <a href="https://telegraph.p3k.io/">Telegraph</a>.</p>
