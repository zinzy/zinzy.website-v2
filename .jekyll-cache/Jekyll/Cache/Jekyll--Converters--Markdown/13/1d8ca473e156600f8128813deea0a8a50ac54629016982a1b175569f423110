I"Ç<p>Iâ€™m Zinzy Waleson, a Dutch Afropean person living and working in Amsterdam. I enjoy the art of personal web publishing. This website contains working notes on a variety of topics, as well as casual updates on whatâ€™s keeping me busy.</p>

<p>I share a little shoebox on the Amsterdam East side with Anja, who is, and Iâ€™m biased, dynamite. I enjoy learning the love language of cooking, gardening, being out in nature, making music, embroidery, and monster disaster movies.</p>
