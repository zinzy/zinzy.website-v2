I" <p>Sometimes I zoom out of the daily reality of my life to remind myself that I hate dogs. Iâ€™ve always hated dogs. I hate all dogs except corgis. On top of all of these strong feelings, Iâ€™m a cat person. All of this goes to show how peculiar it is that Anja and I adopted a dog in February of 2023.</p>

<p>It wasnâ€™t a straightforward tale, either. The thought of bringing home a dog hadnâ€™t ever entered my mind. When Anja casually mentioned she liked the way a particular dog looked that she noticed in the street, and when I said â€œwtf why are you looking at dogs?!â€ and she said â€œI donâ€™t know, I could see us with a dog in the futureâ€ and I said â€œwho <em>are</em> you even anymore?!â€, I considered my future with her.</p>

<p>But, you know, five minutes of semi-awkward small talk about a pregnant dog between Anja and her therapist later, and here we are. Lemonade, Lemonade, Lemonade. I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d have it in me.</p>

<p>Lemonade has been the central topic in my diaryâ€™s archive at least between February and April of 2023. If you donâ€™t like dog stuff, just skip that part. Or maybe donâ€™t ever even return. I donâ€™t know when Iâ€™ll stop writing about her.</p>

<p>Sheâ€™s a mix between her Pembroke mother and her Cardigan father, and so far she takes strongly after her father. She sleeps a lot, and when she doesnâ€™t, she is curious, playful, cuddly, and an all-round friendly super star.</p>
