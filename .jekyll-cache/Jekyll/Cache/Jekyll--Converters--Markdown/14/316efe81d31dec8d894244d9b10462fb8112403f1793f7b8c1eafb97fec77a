I"é<p>Itâ€™s odd to think about what life was like in the Spring of 2021, or even 2020. Sure, we were definitely working on our little street-side garden, hoping to bring some color to the neighborhood, but other than that, not much was the same at home. We had a living room office, each with our own command center. Now, things are slowly returning to normal. Weâ€™ve installed new kitchen counters, getting our couch reupholstered. It feels like the house is becoming a home again.</p>

<p>At Leeruniek, Iâ€™m focused on creating a user-centered mode of collaboration. Itâ€™s great fun work with colleagues from outside the product team, and develop a shared understanding of what we and what we do mean to our customers. Part of this effort involves cultivating a culture of receiving and giving feedback, something I find very refreshing. Weâ€™re also hiring in the product team and weâ€™ve already found a new engineer and a new designer. Iâ€™m looking forward to exploring our new team setup.</p>
