After five years of learning, falling on my face, making friends, and getting to know the travel industry, the time has come for me to say goodbye to [Airtrade](https://airtrade.com). This year, the travel industry took a huge blow, with many of the small and big clients we've acquired over the years in serious heavy water. What's more, five years is a good run, wouldn't you say?

My next adventure is taking me even deeper into making tools for people at work, and I couldn't be more thrilled. I'm joining [Leeruniek](https://leeruniek.nl), a startup creating data-driven educational technology. They're a smaller team than what I worked with the past five years, and I'm curious to see what impact that has on the way I work.

There are a lot of interesting challenges to take care of at Leeruniek, and I'm eager to get my hands dirty!
