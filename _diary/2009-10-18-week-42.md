1. I can remember what was taught in my Applied Linguistics class by the shirt my professor wore.
2. My biggest secret is an unending fascination for the [Momversation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momversation) in which mommy bloggers discuss motherhood.
3. Some people in my Dutch Language and Culture program are bad at spelling. All of them want to be writers.
4. Times a day I realize I probably don't want kids: 17.
5. I'm terrified of failing University. During the day I'm scared, and when I'm not scared, I'm asleep. I'm a 4.5 GPA.
6. Sometimes I miss Frédérique Huydts.
7. Annual occasions that prompt a re-reading of _Bridget Jones' Diary_: birthday and New Year's.
