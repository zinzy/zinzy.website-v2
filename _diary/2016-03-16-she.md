"Slept a little, had a midnight snack, went in for a bathroom break. Slept some more. Basically the life of a four-year-old" she says, and she tells me about her flight to Stockholm. She has been sleeping poorly lately; I say "lately" but I only met her last month, so I don't know what her sleep hygiene is, although she says "it has improved since I began falling asleep in your arms". I imagine how she sleeps on the plane, entertaining the other passengers, cabin crew, and pilots with her stupefyingly loud snores.
