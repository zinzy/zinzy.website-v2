She blesses Anja, me, and a handful of other people who carved out time in their Sunday evenings to come to Church. I have never been inside this particular church building before, and chuckle at how *new* the Old Catholic decor is: in imagery and candle lighting possibilities it's reminiscent of the average Dutch Roman Catholic church. Its white walls and central heating tell me something different.

You may think I chose this church because the woman blessing us is Desmond Tutu's daughter, the Reverend Canon Mpho Tutu van Furth, and because Anja and I can't help but fangirl. I'm here because she's a Black queer person leading a church service that I can attend in person. I never thought I would see the day. 

Dare I wonder whether I have found a new church in [All Saints Amsterdam](https://allsaintsamsterdam.com/)?
