Her Summer break started yesterday, and as always it is an event. I am so excited about getting everything right that I mostly present as a frantic killjoy. _Jeopardy_ makes everything better.

I start today with my usual bike route past the bakeries. Niemeijer for pain au choc and canel√©s, followed by tiger buns and krentenbollen at [Simon Meijssen](https://simonmeijssen.nl/). Niemeijer won best croissant of Amsterdam, but I think they're too bready.

In the window of Meijssen they're showcasing pride muffins. Neither of us likes muffins, but I buy two anyway. They're surprisingly good.
